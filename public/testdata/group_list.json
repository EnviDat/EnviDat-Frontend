      "description": "According to current climate scenarios for Switzerland and for the 21st century, strong changes in temperature and precipitation patterns are anticipated. These changes are likely to profoundly transform existing landscapes, which calls for caution as these landscapes and their diversity represent a key resource for Switzerland's life quality and economy. Thus, transformations in typical (cultural) landscapes induced by changes in climate can have undesirable social and economic consequences, which in turn are exacerbated by the fact that public policies are typically sectorial.\r\n\r\nDespite the importance of landscapes for Switzerland, their possible modifications in response to climate change have so far only been the subject of a limited number of studies. To date, the necessary knowledge and tools are therefore lacking to raise public awareness about the evolution of Swiss landscapes in response to climatic changes. Such tools would also help the formulation of cross-sectoral public policies likely to contribute to the preservation of unique landscape features that are essential for Switzerland. Accordingly, there is an urgent need to develop tools to understand, track, and anticipate landscape transformations as well as the changes in the services these landscape offer to society. In this context, the landscape indicators are interesting because they describe the evolution of landscapes in an objective manner and thus constitute decision-making aid instruments.\r\nThis project developed scenarios about possible effects of climate change on the most important landscape types of Switzerland and enabled the animated visualization of these effects for communication and awareness raising purposes. The scenarios included two different strategies how politics and society could adapt to climate change: a) slow and reactive adaptation, and b) anticipatory and proactive adaptation. The project focused on two case study regions of typical Swiss landscapes: i) Entremont (VS) as a mountain region in the Swiss Alps, and ii) Seeland (BE) as a lowland region on the Swiss Plateau.\r\n\r\nThe project the following products:\r\n- Storylines based on literature and expert consultations conveying perceived landscape changes (published in a WSL Report in German and French);\r\n- Interactive maps predicting landscape changes for the periods 2050 and 2100 for the two case study regions using projections of landscapes as well as biophysical indicators and landscape services;\r\n- Visualizations of the potential landscape changes in interactive 360° panorama pictures and teaser videos for the two case study regions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project is a collaboration between the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow, and Landscape Research (WSL), the Interdisciplinary Centre for Mountain Research of the University of Lausanne (ICMR), the Fondation Jean-Marcel Aubert in Champex-Lac, the Global Mountain Biodiversity Assessment, the Swiss Foundation for Landscape Conservation (Fondation suisse pour la protection et l'aménagement du paysage), and Ikonaut GmbH.\r\n\r\n[See how Swiss landscapes will look like in 2100.](https://viergrad.envidat.ch)\r\n\r\n[Download land-use/land-cover maps of Switzerland for the future.](https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/swiss_lulc_forecast_21th_century)",

We modelled the spatial suitability for each LULC class with a neural network (NN) using >200 predictors and accounting for climate and policy changes. We used data augmentation to increase performance for underrepresented classes, resulting in an overall quantity disagreement of 0.053 and allocation disagreement of 0.15, which indicate good model performance. These class-specific spatial suitability maps outputted by the NN were then merged in a single LULC map per time-step using the CLUE-S algorithm, accounting for LULC demand for the future and a set of LULC transition rules. As the first LULC forecast for Switzerland at a thematic resolution comparable to available LULC  maps for the past, this product lends itself to applications in land-use planning, resource management, ecological and hydraulic modelling, habitat restoration and conservation.",

      "description": "During the [RACLETS](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/raclets-field-campaign) campaign aerosol properties were measured in Davos Wolfang (LON: 9.853594, LAT: 46.835577), at an elevation of 1630 m above sea level (a.s.l.), which is in a valley between lake Davos in the South and Laret in the North. The second measurement site for aerosol particles was on a mountain site, called Weissfluhjoch (LON: 9.806475, LAT: 46.832964), at an elevation of 2700 m a.s.l. The instruments were owned and operated by ETH Zurich and University of Basel. \r\n\r\nThe aerosol size spectra from 15 nm to 40 &#956; m were recorded with a combination of SMPS (model 3938, TSI Inc.), APS (model 3321, TSI Inc.), and OPCs (OPC-N3, Alphasense ; GT-526S Met One Instruments, Inc.).\r\nIn-situ measurements of Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) were carried out with a CCN chamber (CCNC, Droplet Measurement Technologies). LINDA (LED based Ice Nucleation Detection Aparatus, University of Basel), DRINCZ (Droplet Ice Nuclei Counter Zurich, ETH Zurich), and a cold stage were used to investigate ice nucleating particle (INP) concentrations by drop freezing experiments. Information about the secondary ice fraction was gained by melting and re-freezing single dendrites. For further chemical analysis, particles larger than 0.5 &#956;m were collected with an air sampler (Coriolis &#956;, bertin Instruments) using a cyclone technology to separate particles from the air into the sample liquid. \r\n\r\nInformation on [precipitation](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/precipitation), [wind](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/remote-sensing-raclets), [meteorological parameters](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/meteorology), [cloud properties](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/remote-sensing-raclets) and [cloud composition](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/clouds-in-situ-raclets) were gained at the valley station. [Snowflake](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/snow) properties were investigated at the mountaintop station. \r\n\r\n[HoloBalloon](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/clouds-in-situ-raclets) and [radiosondes](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/meteorology) were launched close to the aerosol measurement station in Davos Wolfgang. The OceaNet container hosting [remote sensing](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/remote-sensing-raclets) instruments and a disdrometer to measure [precipitation](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/precipitation) were placed in the same area.\r\n\r\n![pic not found](https://iacweb.ethz.ch/data/holimo/images/notUploaded/Jan/IMG_20190209_103151_scale.jpg)\r\n\r\nImage 1: Measurement site Davos Wolfgang. &#169; Jan Henneberger.\r\n\r\n\r\n![pic not found](https://iacweb.ethz.ch/data/holimo/images/notUploaded/Claudia/IMG_8970_scale.JPG)\r\n\r\nImage 2: Measurement site Weissfluhjoch. &#169; Claudia Mignani.\r\n",

Optical and aerodynamic particle counters, as well as a scanning mobility particle size spectrometer and an ice nuclei counter were deployed to report particle concentrations and size distributions in fine (10-1000 nm) and coarse mode (> 1000 nm), cloud condensation nuclei concentrations (CCNCs), and ice nuclei particle concentrations (ICNCs). The ambient particles were transported via a heated inlet to be distributed to the particle detecting devices inside the setup room. \r\n\r\nOptical Particle Counter (OPC): Light scattering of a diode laser beam caused by travelling particles is used in the both, the OPC-N3 (0.41 - 38.5 &#956;m) and GT-526S (0.3 – 5 &#956;m), to determine their size and number concentration. For the OPC-N3, particle size spectra and concentration data are used afterwards to calculate PM&#8321;, PM&#8322;,&#8325; and PM&#8321;&#8320; (assumptions: particle density: 1.65 g cm&#713;&#179;, refractive index: 1.5+i0). \r\n\r\nAerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS): The APS (3321, TSI Inc.) measured the particle size distribution for aerodynamic diameters between 0.5 &#956;m and ~20 &#956;m by the particle’s time-of-flight and light-scattering intensity (assumptions: particle density 1 g cm&#713;&#179;). \r\n\r\nScanning Mobility Particle Size Spectrometer (SMPS): Particle number concentrations in a size range between 12 and 460 nm (electrical mobility diameter) were measured at Davos Wolfgang, using a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer Spectrometer (SMPS 3938, TSI Inc.). The classifier (3082, TSI Inc.) was equipped with a neutralizer (3088, TSI Inc.) and a differential mobility analyzer working with negative polarity (3081, TSI Inc.). The size selected particles were counted by a water-based condensation particle counter (3787 TSI Inc.).

Particles larger than 0.5 &#956;m were drawn with an air flow rate of up to 300 l min&#8254;&#185; into the cone and centrifuged into the wall of the cone due to the forming vortex. The liquid sample was transferred into the LED based Ice Nucleation Detection Apparatus (LINDA, University of Basel) to study heterogeneous ice formation (immersion freezing mode) of ambient airborne particles. \r\n",

          "notes": "__Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) data:__ A Droplet Measurement Technologies (DMT) single-column continuous-flow streamwise thermal gradient chamber (CFSTGC; Roberts and Nenes, 2005) was deployed at the measurement site Weissfluhjoch (2700 m a.s.l., LON: 9.806475, LAT: 46.832964) to record the in-situ CCN number concentrations between February 24 and March 8 2019 for different supersaturations (SS). To account for the difference between the ambient (~735 mbar) and the calibration pressure (~800 mbar), the SS reported by the instrument is adjusted by a factor of 0.92. The CFSTGC was cycled between 6 discrete SS values ranging from 0.09% to 0.74%, producing a full CCN spectrum every hour. The raw CCN measurements are filtered to discount periods of transient operation and whenever the room temperature housing the instrument changed sufficiently to induce a reset in column temperature. Additional information can be found in Section 2.1.2 [here](https://acp.copernicus.org/preprints/acp-2020-1036/).\r\n\r\n__Hygroscopicity data:__ The CCN number concentration measurements were directly related to the size distribution and total aerosol concentration data measured by the Scanning Mobility Particle Size Spectrometer (SMPS) instrument at the same station (https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/aerosol-data-weissfluhjoch) to infer the particles hygroscopicity parameter (kappa). For each SMPS scan, the particles critical dry diameter (Dcr) is estimated by integrating backward the SMPS size distribution, until the aerosol number matches the CCN concentration observed for the same time period as the SMPS scan. Assuming the particle chemical composition is internally mixed, the kappa is determined from Dcr and SS, applying Köhler theory. Additional information can be found in Section 2.2 [here](https://acp.copernicus.org/preprints/acp-2020-1036/).\r\n\r\n__Predicted cloud droplet numbers:__ Droplet calculations are carried out with the physically based aerosol activation parameterization of Morales and Nenes (2014), employing the “characteristic velocity” approach of Morales and Nenes (2010). Aerosol size distribution observations required to predict the cloud droplet numbers and maximum in-cloud supersaturation are obtained from the SMPS instrument deployed at Weissfluhjoch. The required vertical velocity measurements are derived from the wind Doppler Lidar (https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/lidar-wind-profiler-data) deployed at Davos Wolfgang and are extracted for the altitude of interest, being 1100 m above ground level for Weissfluhjoch. Additional information can be found in Section 2.3 [here](https://acp.copernicus.org/preprints/acp-2020-1036/).\r\n\r\n",

Preserving their breeding sites is an essential part of amphibian conservation. 70 % of the indigenous amphibian species are now on the Red List of Endangered Swiss amphibians. The amphibian breeding sites module is coordinated by info fauna karch (the Swiss Amphibian and Reptile Coordination Centre) while local experts conduct field surveys.\r\nThe WBS sub-sample comprises 258 amphibian breeding sites. These include 124 objects already examined for the 2005 Red List update as well as 18 additional objects, integrated after the inventory update of 2017. The sample encompasses all amphibian species and biogeographic regions of Switzerland. The national inventory distinguishes between fixed objects (ponds and other permanent wetlands) and ‘mobile’ objects (mainly gravel pits). The 258 objects of the WBS sample are composed of 218 fixed and 40 mobile objects.\r\nLow-elevation sites are surveyed four times and high-elevation sites twice between March and June. During the field surveys, all detected amphibian species are recorded. The data is stored at info fauna karch and enables the tracking of trends in amphibian populations nationwide and in each of the biogeographical regions. Cantons have access to the data via the virtual database VDC.\r\n",

HoloBalloon, a tethered balloon system, was launched at Davos Wolfgang at an elevation of 1630 m above sea level (a.s.l.) and ascended up to 800 m above ground. HoloGondel was mount on the upper section of the Gotschnabahn cable car, running between Gotschnaboden (1779 m a.s.l.) and Gotschnagrat (2285 m a.s.l.). \r\n\r\nBoth platforms were equipped with a holographic imager HOLIMO to measure the cloud microphysics. HOLIMO was used to image cloud particles in a size range between 6 &#956;m and 2 mm in a three-dimensional sample volume. Cloud droplets and ice crystals were discriminated above 25 &#956;m based on the shape of their 2D shadowgraph. The products are phase resolved particle size distributions, concentrations, water contents and spatial distribution of the cloud particles. In addition to HOLIMO, the size distribution between 0.3 and 20 &#956;m was measured by an optical particle counter covering the larger aerosol particles and smallest cloud droplets in addition to [meteorological parameters](https://www.envidat.ch/group/meteorology) (temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure). \r\n\r\nInstruments to measure [aerosol concentrations](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/aerosols-raclets), [meteorological parameters](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/meteorology), [wind profiles/velocities](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/remote-sensing-raclets), [precipitation](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/precipitation) and the [CloudNet station](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/remote-sensing-raclets) were close to the location where HoloBalloon and [radiosondes](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/meteorology) were launched. \r\n\r\n![image missing](https://iacweb.ethz.ch/data/holimo/images/notUploaded/Annika/DSC_4601-2_Scale.jpg)\r\n\r\n![image missing](https://iacweb.ethz.ch/data/holimo/images/notUploaded/Annika/DSC_4605-2_Scale.jpg)\r\n\r\nImages 1 and 2: HoloBalloon at Davos Wolfgang. &#169; Annika Lauber\r\n\r\n![image missing](https://iacweb.ethz.ch/data/holimo/images/notUploaded/Annika/DSC_4674_Scale.jpg)\r\n\r\n![image missing](https://iacweb.ethz.ch/data/holimo/images/notUploaded/Annika/DSC_4704_scale.jpg)\r\n\r\nImages 3 and 4: Hologondel mounted at Gotschnabahn. &#169; Annika Lauber",

We conducted the study in two highly drought-affected regions in northern Switzerland and one less drought-affected region located further south. We quantified the development of crown dieback and tree mortality as well as secondary drought damage, i.e. the presence of bleeding cankers and bark beetle infestations, in these trees for three consecutive years. We also determined the impact of several potential climate- and stand-related (predisposing) factors  on  mortality  and  drought  legacy  processes.",

We elaborate basic knowledge for an adaptive forest management.",

          "notes": "Comparing environmental DNA metabarcoding and underwater visual census to monitor tropical reef fishes, the Providencia island data set.\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween June 29 and July 5, 2018, we collected a total of 20 water samples from 10 stations around Providencia Island, with two filtration replicates per station. Providencia Island is located in the southwestern Caribbean Sea and forms part of the UNESCO Seaflower Biosphere Reserve in Colombia. This island, which belongs to the San Andrés, Providencia, and Santa Catalina Archipelago, is characterized by a complex barrier reef on a calcareous platform surrounding an extinct Miocene volcano. The high habitat diversity provides a range of substratum types and coral reefs, influencing the diversity, abundance, and distribution of coral reef fishes. Each station consisted of a transect of 2 km at an overall constant distance from the coast. We recorded the GPS coordinates at the start and end of the transect. We conducted eDNA sampling by using a filtration device composed of an Athena® peristaltic pump (Proactive Environmental Products LLC, Bradenton, Florida, USA; nominal flow of 1.0 L/min), a VigiDNA® 0.20 μM cross-flow filtration capsule (SPYGEN, le Bourget du Lac, France) and disposable sterile tubing for each filtration capsule. We performed two filtration replicates in parallel on each side of a boat, at each station, for 30 min corresponding to a volume of ~30 L of water filtered by each capsule. At the end of each filtration, the water inside the capsules was emptied, and we filled the capsules with 80 ml of CL1 Conservation buffer (SPYGEN, le Bourget du Lac, France) and stored at room temperature. We followed a strict contamination control protocol in both field and laboratory stages (Valentini et al., 2016). Each water sample processing included the use of disposable gloves and single-use filtration equipment to avoid any risk of contamination. Libraries were prepared with ligation using the MetaFast protocol (Fasteris).\r\n\r\nData content: \r\n\t* rawdata/: contains the raw reads for each individual sample. One archive contains the paired-end reads specified by the _R1 or _R2 suffix as well as individually tagged PCR replicates (if available) together with an archive containing all extraction and PCR blank samples of the library. Reads have been demultiplexed using cutadapt but not trimmed, individual demultiplexing tags and primers remain present in the sequences.  \r\n\t* taxadata/: contains the table with all detected taxonomy for each sample after bioinformatic processing (see Polanco et al. 2020 for details; https://doi.org/10.1002/edn3.140) and associated field metadata. \r\n\t* metadata/: contains two metadata files, one related to the data collected in the field for each filter, and the second related to the sequencing process in the lab (including the tag sequence, library name, and marker information for each sample)\r\n  \r\n",

Tayrona Park has a heterogeneous coastal topography composed of metamorphic rocks, with numerous rocky headlands, islets, and bays (Garzón-Ferreira & Díaz, 2003). Coral and other hard-bottom communities are distributed along the coast, mainly as fringing reefs, while seagrass beds, mangroves, and coral reefs have developed to some extent in sheltered conditions within the bays (Garzón-Ferreira & Cano, 1991). The study was carried out in Gayraca Bay, where corals on the exposed side exhibit mainly massive to encrusting growth forms with colonies and a reef-like structure. In Gayraca Bay, we sampled two filtration replicates from each of six stations, for a total of 12 water samples, from 23 to 26 October 2018. We recorded the GPS coordinates at the start and end of the transect. We conducted eDNA sampling by using a filtration device composed of an Athena® peristaltic pump (Proactive Environmental Products LLC, Bradenton, Florida, USA; nominal flow of 1.0 L/min), a VigiDNA® 0.20 μM cross-flow filtration capsule (SPYGEN, le Bourget du Lac, France) and disposable sterile tubing for each filtration capsule.

          "notes": "Fish environmental DNA data set collected in the shallow seamount of La Pérouse located between Madagascar and Réunion Island \n\n\nIn 2019, we sampled the shallow seamount of La Pérouse, located between Madagascar and Réunion Island in the WIO. La Pérouse is an extinct volcano with a summit depth at 60 m below the sea surface. The plateau of the summit has a maximum length of 12 km and a maximum width of 4 km. One side of the seamount might have collapsed in the past, leading to a less common crescent-shaped summit. The abyssal plains that surround this isolated pinnacle are at a depth of 5000 m. Despite its proximity to Réunion Island (160 km northwest), La Pérouse and its surroundings are still poorly studied.\n\nTo sample eDNA in this location we used a submersible pump (Subspace, Geneva, Switzerland; nominal flow of ~ 1.0 L/min) to collect samples at various depths during close circuit rebreather dives. The pump has an internal battery and can be activated underwater allowing in situ filtration directly at the targeted habitat and depth. The filtration lasted for 30 min to collect a total water volume of ~ 30 L. During close circuit rebreather dives, water samples from various depths, ranging from 60 to 140 m below the sea surface, were collected using only the Submersible method (eight stations: no replicates). Out of the eight water samples, six were collected during the day, while two were collected at night (IS2_1 at 62 m and IS7_1 at 100–125 m). We applied this filtration protocols to collect and filter water throughout a VigiDNA® 0.2 μM cross-flow filtration capsule (SPYGEN, le Bourget du Lac, France) using disposable sterile tubing for each filtration capsule. After the filtration process, the remaining water in the capsules was emptied. The capsules were then filled with 80 ml of lysis conservation buffer (CL1 buffer SPYGEN, le Bourget du Lac, France) and stored at room temperature in the dark. At La Pérouse, a total of eight water samples were collected during the MONT LA PÉROUSE expedition (https://gombessa-expeditions.com/mont-la-perouse/) on board the ship La Curieuse to the seamount La Pérouse from October 27th to November 5th 2019. We followed a strict contamination control protocol in both field and laboratory stages. Each water sample processing included the use of disposable gloves and single-use filtration equipment to avoid any risk of contamination. Libraries were prepared with ligation using the MetaFast protocol (Fasteris).\n\nData content: \n\t* rawdata/: contains the raw reads for each individual sample. One archive contains the paired-end reads specified by the _R1 or _R2 suffix as well as individually tagged PCR replicates (if available) together with an archive containing all extraction and PCR blank samples of the library. Reads have been demultiplexed using cutadapt but not trimmed, individual demultiplexing tags and primers remain present in the sequences.  \n\t* taxadata/: contains the table with all detected taxonomy for each sample after bioinformatic processing (see Polanco et al. 2020 for details; https://doi.org/10.1002/edn3.140) and associated field metadata. \n\t* metadata/: contains two metadata files, one related to the data collected in the field for each filter, and the second related to the sequencing process in the lab (including the tag sequence, library name, and marker information for each sample)\n",

          "notes": "Fish environmental DNA data set collected in the French Scattered Islands across Surface and Seamount Habitats\n\nDuring a scientific expedition aboard the R/V Marion Dufresne in April 2019, spanning from the 8th to the 28th, we collected  75 water samples in four French Scattered Islands (Europa, Glorieuse, Juan de Nova, and Tromelin). These samples comprised two types: transect samples of surface water and fixed point samples taken from the surface to deeper waters. Regarding transect sampling, 36 water samples were collected along 18 transects across the four islands (Europa = 6; Glorieuse = 5; Juan de Nova = 4; Tromelin = 3). We conducted filtration replicates in parallel, with filtration tubes positioned a few centimeters below the surface on each side of the boat. Each transect involved a 30-minute filtration of approximately 30 liters. Initial transects were performed close to the shore on shallow reefs. Subsequent transects were conducted at various distances from the initial points, accounting for observed changes in depth. For Europa, transects were carried out at distances of 50, 300, and 600 meters from the initial point due to a gradual decrease in depth extending from the island's northern part. In contrast, depth decreased rapidly from the initial points in Glorieuse and Tromelin. Therefore, transects were performed at distances of 50, 100, and 300 meters from the initial points for Glorieuse, and at distances of 50 and 100 meters for Tromelin, considering the island's small size, sudden depth decrease, and safety concerns (see Figure 1a–d).\nRegarding fixed point sampling, eDNA was collected using 12L Niskin bottles from the surface to deeper habitats at various locations (Europa = 2; Glorieuse = 1; Juan de Nova = 1; Tromelin = 1; Canyon = 1; Juan_Mayotte = 1; Seamount = 1; Seamount_near_Tromelin = 1), covering depths from -1 meter to -3000 meters (from 12L, 24L, or 30L bottles).\nIn both sampling cases the filtration equipment comprised an Athena® peristaltic pump (Proactive Environmental Products LLC, Bradenton, Florida, USA; nominal flow of 1.0 L min-1), a VigiDNA® 0.2 µM cross flow filtration capsule (SPYGEN, le Bourget du Lac, France), and disposable sterile tubing for each filtration capsule. After filtration, capsules were emptied of water, filled with 80 mL of CL1 conservation buffer (SPYGEN, le Bourget du Lac, France), and stored at room temperature in the dark. We followed a strict contamination control protocol in both field and laboratory stages (Valentini et al., 2016). Each water sample processing included the use of disposable gloves and single-use filtration equipment to avoid any risk of contamination. Libraries were prepared with ligation using the MetaFast protocol (Fasteris).\n\nData content: \n\t* rawdata/: contains the raw reads for each individual sample.

The French international EVHOE bottom trawl survey is carried out annually during autumn in the BoB to monitor demersal fish resources. At each site, we sampled seawater using Niskin bottles deployed with a circular rosette. There were nine bottles on the rosette, each of them able to hold ∼5 l of water. At each site, we first cleaned the circular rosette and bottles with freshwater, then lowered the rosette (with bottles open) to 5 m above the sea bottom, and finally closed the bottles remotely from the boat. The 45 l of sampled water was transferred to four disposable and sterilized plastic bags of 11.25 l each to perform the filtration on-board in a laboratory dedicated to the processing of eDNA samples. To speed up the filtration process, we used two identical filtration devices, each composed of an Athena® peristaltic pump (Proactive Environmental Products LLC, Bradenton, Florida, USA; nominal flow of 1.0 l min–1 ), a VigiDNA 0.20 μm filtration capsule (SPYGEN, le Bourget du Lac, France), and disposable sterile tubing. Each filtration device filtered the water contained in two plastic bags (22.5 l), which represent two replicates per sampling site. We followed a rigorous protocol to avoid contamination during fieldwork, using disposable gloves and single-use filtration equipment and plastic bags to process each water sample. At the end of each filtration, we emptied the water inside the capsule that we replaced by 80 ml of CL1 conservation buffer and stored the samples at room temperature following the specifications of the manufacturer (SPYGEN, Le Bourget du Lac, France). We processed the eDNA capsules at SPYGEN, following the protocol proposed by Polanco-Fernández et al., (2020). We performed library preparation and sequencing at Fasteris (Geneva, Switzerland). Specifically, we prepared four libraries using the MetaFast protocol (a ligation-based method) and sequenced them separately. We carried out paired-end sequencing using a MiSeq sequencer (2 × 125 bp, Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) on two MiSeq Flow Cell Kits (v3; Illumina), following the manufacturer’s instructions.

We performed two filtration replicates in parallel on each side of a boat, at each station, for 30 min corresponding to a volume of ~30 L of water filtered by each capsule. At the end of each filtration, the water inside the capsules was emptied, and we filled the capsules with 80 ml of CL1 Conservation buffer (SPYGEN, le Bourget du Lac, France) and stored at room temperature. We followed a strict contamination control protocol in both field and laboratory stages (Valentini et al., 2016).

          "notes": "Catchment-based sampling of river eDNA integrates terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity of alpine landscapes\r\n\r\nFrom 22-Jun-2020 to 26-Jun-2020, we sampled five sites comprising one low, two intermediate and two high-elevation sites per catchment (Fig. 1a). We visited two catchments per day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—for a total of ten catchments. All samples per catchment were collected within a maximum four-hour period by three groups of samplers. The intermediate and high-elevation sites were situated along two tributaries leading into the low-elevation site of the river. We used three filters for each relative elevation class and filtered 60 L per relative elevation class. We sampled 30 L per tributary for a combined volume of 60 L at the intermediate and high-elevation sites. In total, 180 L were sampled in total per catchment. A filtration device composed of either the Athena® peristaltic pump (Proactive Environmental Products LLC; 1 L/min nominal flow) or the Subspace® underwater peristaltic pump (Subspace Pictures; 1 L/min nominal flow), combined with a VigiDNA® 0.2 µM cross-flow filtration capsule (VigiDNA, SPYGEN) was used in order to filter a large water volume. We used a finer mesh than the recommended VigiDNA® 0.45 µM cross-flow filtration capsule to maximise the capture of biological material since mountain water does not transport high quantities of sediments. For each filtration capsule, we used disposable sterile tubing. At the end of each filtration, we emptied the water inside the capsules, replaced it with 80 ml of CL1 conservation buffer (SPYGEN), and stored it at room temperature. We followed a strict contamination control protocol in both field and laboratory stages (Goldberg et al. 2016; Valentini et al. 2016). Each water sample was processed using disposable gloves and single-use filtration equipment. We used two primer sets targeting vertebrates (Vert01, forward: − TTAGATACCCCACTATGC, reverse: − TAGAACAGGCTCCTCTAG, mean marker length: 97 bp) and spermatophytes (g-h/Sper01, forward: − GGGCAATCCTGAGCCAA, reverse: CCATTGAGTCTCTGCACCTATC, mean marker length: 48 bp). Though both primers are relatively broad with low species-level resolution, we selected them as the goal was to minimise cost and effort and maximise the identification of a broad range of taxa which can represent the species assemblages of the region. Libraries were prepared with ligation using the MetaFast protocol (Fasteris).  ",

The study of slope stability in ice-bearing permafrost features (e.g. rock glaciers, moraines) and of debris flows and rockfall in permafrost areas is becoming increasingly relevant due to the growing use of mountain areas for human activities. We investigate the interactions between permafrost, mountain infrastructure and the snow cover.",

The IAC focuses on atmospheric and climate processes, including links to the hydrosphere, cryosphere, and biosphere. Research is directed at understanding how human activities alter these processes via changes in greenhouse gases, aerosols, chemical constituents, and land surfaces and how this impacts upon climate, ozone, UV radiation, pollutant exposure, ecosystems, water resources and extreme events. Emphasisis placed on the improvement of the predictive capabilities on weather and climate time scales and on knowledge transfer between basic sciences, applied sciences, and society. ",

The one-moment scheme which described cloud microphysical processes with prognostic variables was replaced by a two-moment scheme which considered a higher number of hydrometeor classes and used prescribed CCN and INP concentrations. \r\n\r\nThe results of the two-moment scheme were compared to both, the operationally used one-moment scheme and the in-situ cloud microphysical data and precipitation measurements of the campaign. In addition to tuning of parameterizations of cloud microphysical processes, which are important prerequisites for the stabilization of orographic MPCs and therewith orographic precipitation in the model, the influence of anthropogenic aerosol on precipitation was assesd. The simulations were conducted with various CCN and INP concentrations under the same meteorological conditions to represent clean and polluted scenarios.    \r\n",

Droplet calculations are carried out with the physically based aerosol activation parameterization of Morales and Nenes (2014), employing the “characteristic velocity” approach of Morales and Nenes (2010). Aerosol size distribution observations required to predict the cloud droplet numbers and maximum in-cloud supersaturation are obtained from a Scanning Mobility Particle Size Spectrometer (SMPS) instrument deployed at Davos Wolfgang (https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/aerosol-data-davos-wolfgang). The required vertical velocity measurements are derived from the wind Doppler Lidar (https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/lidar-wind-profiler-data) deployed at the same station and are extracted from the first bin of the instrument, being 200 m above ground level. The hygroscopic properties of the particles measured at Davos Wolfgang could not be estimated, owing to a lack of concurrent CCN measurements. As a sensitivity test, droplet calculations are performed assuming two different values of the aerosol hygroscopicity parameter, 0.1 and 0.25, based on the analysis carried out for Weissfluhjoch.

          "notes": "__Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) data:__ A Droplet Measurement Technologies (DMT) single-column continuous-flow streamwise thermal gradient chamber (CFSTGC; Roberts and Nenes, 2005) was deployed at the measurement site Weissfluhjoch (2700 m a.s.l., LON: 9.806475, LAT: 46.832964) to record the in-situ CCN number concentrations between February 24 and March 8 2019 for different supersaturations (SS). To account for the difference between the ambient (~735 mbar) and the calibration pressure (~800 mbar), the SS reported by the instrument is adjusted by a factor of 0.92. The CFSTGC was cycled between 6 discrete SS values ranging from 0.09% to 0.74%, producing a full CCN spectrum every hour. The raw CCN measurements are filtered to discount periods of transient operation and whenever the room temperature housing the instrument changed sufficiently to induce a reset in column temperature. Additional information can be found in Section 2.1.2 [here](https://acp.copernicus.org/preprints/acp-2020-1036/).\r\n\r\n__Hygroscopicity data:__ The CCN number concentration measurements were directly related to the size distribution and total aerosol concentration data measured by the Scanning Mobility Particle Size Spectrometer (SMPS) instrument at the same station (https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/aerosol-data-weissfluhjoch) to infer the particles hygroscopicity parameter (kappa). For each SMPS scan, the particles critical dry diameter (Dcr) is estimated by integrating backward the SMPS size distribution, until the aerosol number matches the CCN concentration observed for the same time period as the SMPS scan. Assuming the particle chemical composition is internally mixed, the kappa is determined from Dcr and SS, applying Köhler theory. Additional information can be found in Section 2.2 [here](https://acp.copernicus.org/preprints/acp-2020-1036/).\r\n\r\n__Predicted cloud droplet numbers:__ Droplet calculations are carried out with the physically based aerosol activation parameterization of Morales and Nenes (2014), employing the “characteristic velocity” approach of Morales and Nenes (2010).

      "description": "To protect its biodiversity and to prevent further habitat loss and the extinction of endangered species, Switzerland designated about 7000 sites of national importance since the early 1990s. These nationally important sites are legally protected and include fens, bogs, dry grasslands, riparian areas, flood plains and amphibian breeding sites. They now are a crucial element of the network of protected sites in Switzerland. In 2011, the WSL Swiss Federal Research Institute and the Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) launched the joint project, \"Monitoring the Effectiveness of Habitat Conservation in Switzerland (WBS)\". Using remote sensing approaches as well as floristic and faunistic field surveys, we monitor whether the sites of national importance are developing along with their conservation targets and whether their area and habitat quality is maintained. \r\nThe remote-sensing module monitors all sites of national importance on a regular basis. Based on these data, an online color-coded warning system has been established to ensure early detection of negative changes and to conduct prompt conservation measures. This tool can be assessed by the responsible federal and cantonal conservation authorities.\r\nThe very laborious field surveys are conducted in a subsample of all sites. Vegetation changes in fens, bogs, dry grasslands, riparian areas and flood plains are interpreted using diversity and compositional measures. The regular sampling of amphibian species and their population-size classes reflect temporal changes in amphibian breeding sites.\r\n\r\nThe project is composed of the following three modules:\r\n\r\n- [_Vegetation module_](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/wbs-vegetation-module)\r\n- [_Amphibian breeding sites module_](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/wbs-amphibian-breeding-sites-module)\r\n- [_Remote-sensing module_](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/wbs-remote-sensing-module) \r\n",

      "description": "Rain or snow reaching the ground as precipitation were measured at a high elevation site and at two locations in the valley over the course of the [RACLETS](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/raclets-field-campaign) campaign: Gotschnagrat (2285 m above sea level - a.s.l.), as well as Laret (1522 m a.s.l.), and Davos Wolfang (1630 m a.s.l.). The applied instruments were owned and operated by ETH Zurich, EPFL and TROPOS.\r\n\r\nThe fall velocity and size of hydrometeors were measured with disdrometers (Parsivel, OTT HydroMet), that are laser based optical systems to measure all types of precipitation, e.g. drizzle, rain, snow, hail and hybrid forms of these classes. The disdrotemer data was continously recording liquid precipitation in a particle size range of 0.2 to 8 mm, solid precipitation in a particle size range of 0.2 to 25 mm, with particle fall velocities between 0.2 and 20 m s&#713;&#185;. Precipitation was dicriminated into 32 size classes and corresponded to 32 particle velocity classes.  \r\n\r\nThe precipitation measurements were accompanied by [snow measurements](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/snow) at Gotschnagrat and in Davos Wolfgang.   Instruments to measure [aerosol concentrations](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/aerosols-raclets), [meteorological parameters](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/meteorology), [wind profiles/velocities](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/remote-sensing-raclets), and the [CloudNet station](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/remote-sensing-raclets) were also located in Davos Wolfgang. \r\n\r\n![image is missing](https://iacweb.ethz.ch/data/holimo/images/notUploaded/Claudia/IMG_8893_Scale.JPG)\r\n\r\nImage 1: Measurement site at Weissfluhjoch. &#169; Claudia Mignani\r\n![image is missing](https://iacweb.ethz.ch/data/holimo/images/notUploaded/Claudia/IMG_8012_Scale.JPG)\r\n\r\nImage2: Measurement site at Davos Wolfgang. &#169; Claudia Mignani\r\n",

Our activities are aimed at the determination of optical and physical properties of aerosols and clouds as well as at the assesment of the general atmospheric state parameters (temperature, wind, moisture).\r\nThe working group has conducted more than 15 field experiments in key regions of climate research where it applies its techniques to understand the role of aerosols and clouds in the climate system. During RACLETS, the ground-based remote sensing working group participated with observations of the mobile Oceanet platform, which is usually deployed during cruises of the research vessel Polarstern. Oceanet carries a multiwavelength Raman polarization lidar and a microwave radiometer as well as standard meteorological sensors. During RACLETS, a 35-GHz cloud radar and a disdrometer were deployed in addition. This equipment was used to process synergies of the remote sensing observations via Cloudnet (http://cloudnet.fmi.fi).\r\n\r\nMore information on: https://www.tropos.de/en/institute/departments/remote-sensing-of-atmospheric-processes-new/ground-based-remote-sensing",

      "description": "### Campaign Overview\r\n\r\nThe __RACLETS__ - _Role of Aerosols and CLouds Enhanced by Topography on Snow_ - campaign uniquely combines cloud and snow research to improve the understanding of precipitation formation in clouds and snow deposition on the ground.  \r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the RACLETS campaign in February and March 2019, an extensive set of instruments was deployed in the Davos regions including aerosol, cloud, precipitation and snow measurements. In a unique cooperation between cloud and snow research groups, this study aimed to observe the complete life cycle of ice crystals:\r\n\r\n- Cloud droplet formation and ice nucleation on aerosol particles\r\n- Growth of cloud droplets and ice crystals to precipitation\r\n- Ice crystal enhancement by ice multiplication\r\n- Precipitation location and amount on the ground\r\n- Redistribution of snow on the ground\r\n\r\n\r\nThe measurements were contextualized by using regional numerical weather models for the atmosphere and high-resolution models for snow deposition.\r\n\r\nTo explore the campaign sites in a short introduction [video](https://iacweb.ethz.ch/data/holimo/images/Davos_campaign_GE_31_Jan.mp4), just click on the picture below. \r\n<br />\r\n[![IMAGE IS MISSING](https://iacweb.ethz.ch/data/holimo/images/RACLETS-OverviewMap_Scale.png)](https://iacweb.ethz.ch/data/holimo/images/Davos_campaign_GE_31_Jan.mp4)\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nTo cover the spatial differences of the topography, instruments were deployed at five different locations and on a cable car. The main measurement site was located in __Davos Wolfang__, 1630 m above sea level (a.s.l.). Here, [clouds](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/clouds-in-situ-raclets) were probed in-situ by a tethered balloon system (HoloBalloon), [radiosondes](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/meteorology) were launched, [precipitation](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/precipitation) was measured (disdrometer), [remote sensing instruments](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/remote-sensing-raclets) were deployed (OceaNet station, Wind Profiler and Wind LIDAR) and [aerosol and INP measurements](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/aerosols-raclets) were carried out to study the atmosphere. The mountain ridge __Gotschna__ separates Davos Wolfgang in the south from Klosters in the north. In __Klosters__ (1170 m a.s.l.), a [ceilometer](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/remote-sensing-raclets) was applied to measure the cloud base. On a cable car, running on the north side of the ridge towards __Gotschnagrat__ (2285 m a.s.l.), HoloGondel was attached, which took in-situ images of ice crystals and droplets in [clouds](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/clouds-in-situ-raclets). A [snow drift station](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/snow) and a [disdrometer](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/precipitation) were located at __Gotschnagrat__. At the mountain site __Weissfluhjoch__ (2700 m a.s.l.), south of __Gotschna__, [Aerosols, INPs, CCNs](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/aerosols-raclets) were measured in addition to analysing [snowflakes](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/snow) and performing [snow measurements](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/snow). [Snow](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/snow) and [precipitation](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/precipitation) measurements were performed in __Laret__, which is located in the valley at an elevation of 1522 m a.s.l. and in a distance of about 1 km north of Davos Wolfgang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Data Files\r\nThe data recorded during the campaign can be accessed via the following subprojects (as link): \r\n\r\n- [_Aerosols_](https://www.envidat.ch/group/aerosols-raclets)\r\n- [_Clouds in-situ_](https://www.envidat.ch/group/clouds-in-situ-raclets)\r\n- [_Meteorology_](https://www.envidat.ch/group/meteorology) \r\n- [_Modelling_](https://www.envidat.ch/group/modeling) \r\n- [_Precipitation_](https://www.envidat.ch/group/precipitation) \r\n- [_Remote Sensing_](https://www.envidat.ch/group/remote-sensing-raclets)\r\n- [_Snow_](https://www.envidat.ch/group/snow) \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n### __Project Partners__\r\nMore information about participating insitutes can be found here: \r\n\r\n- https://duw.unibas.ch/de/home/\r\n- https://www.epfl.ch/en/home/\r\n- http://www.iac.ethz.ch/group/atmospheric-physics.html\r\n- https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/home.html?tab=overview\r\n- https://www.slf.ch/\r\n- https://www.tropos.de/institut/ueber-uns/das-institut/\r\n- https://www.wsl.ch/de/schnee-und-eis.html      \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n### __Related Data__  \r\n\r\nSatellite images and data can be requested at [NASA](https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/).\r\nFurther weather radar data can be requested for certain periods at [Meteoswiss](https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/home/measurement-and-forecasting-systems/atmosphere/weather-radar-network.html).\r\n\r\n\r\n",

For the OPC-N3, particle size spectra and concentration data are used afterwards to calculate PM&#8321;, PM&#8322;,&#8325; and PM&#8321;&#8320; (assumptions: particle density: 1.65 g cm&#713;&#179;, refractive index: 1.5+i0). \r\n\r\nAerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS): The APS (3321, TSI Inc.) measured the particle size distribution for aerodynamic diameters between 0.5 &#956;m and ~20 &#956;m by the particle’s time-of-flight and light-scattering intensity (assumptions: particle density 1 g cm&#713;&#179;). \r\n\r\nScanning Mobility Particle Size Spectrometer (SMPS): Particle number concentrations in a size range between 12 and 460 nm (electrical mobility diameter) were measured at Davos Wolfgang, using a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer Spectrometer (SMPS 3938, TSI Inc.). The classifier (3082, TSI Inc.) was equipped with a neutralizer (3088, TSI Inc.) and a differential mobility analyzer working with negative polarity (3081, TSI Inc.). The size selected particles were counted by a water-based condensation particle counter (3787 TSI Inc.). The TSI AIM software was used to provide particle size distributions by applying multiple charge and diffusion loss corrections (assumptions: particle density 1 g cm&#713;&#179;). \r\n\r\nCoriolis &#956; and LINDA: A microbial air sampler (Coriolis &#956;, bertin Instruments) was used to collect airborne particles for investigating their ice nucleating ability with a droplet freezing device. Particles larger than 0.5 &#956;m were drawn with an air flow rate of up to 300 l min&#8254;&#185; into the cone and centrifuged into the wall of the cone due to the forming vortex. The liquid sample was transferred into the LED based Ice Nucleation Detection Apparatus (LINDA, University of Basel) to study heterogeneous ice formation (immersion freezing mode) of ambient airborne particles. \r\n",

Droplet calculations are carried out with the physically based aerosol activation parameterization of Morales and Nenes (2014), employing the “characteristic velocity” approach of Morales and Nenes (2010). Aerosol size distribution observations required to predict the cloud droplet numbers and maximum in-cloud supersaturation are obtained from a Scanning Mobility Particle Size Spectrometer (SMPS) instrument deployed at Davos Wolfgang (https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/aerosol-data-davos-wolfgang). The required vertical velocity measurements are derived from the wind Doppler Lidar (https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/lidar-wind-profiler-data) deployed at the same station and are extracted from the first bin of the instrument, being 200 m above ground level. The hygroscopic properties of the particles measured at Davos Wolfgang could not be estimated, owing to a lack of concurrent CCN measurements. As a sensitivity test, droplet calculations are performed assuming two different values of the aerosol hygroscopicity parameter, 0.1 and 0.25, based on the analysis carried out for Weissfluhjoch. Additional information can be found in Section 2.3 [here](https://acp.copernicus.org/preprints/acp-2020-1036/).",

          "notes": "__Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) data:__ A Droplet Measurement Technologies (DMT) single-column continuous-flow streamwise thermal gradient chamber (CFSTGC; Roberts and Nenes, 2005) was deployed at the measurement site Weissfluhjoch (2700 m a.s.l., LON: 9.806475, LAT: 46.832964) to record the in-situ CCN number concentrations between February 24 and March 8 2019 for different supersaturations (SS). To account for the difference between the ambient (~735 mbar) and the calibration pressure (~800 mbar), the SS reported by the instrument is adjusted by a factor of 0.92. The CFSTGC was cycled between 6 discrete SS values ranging from 0.09% to 0.74%, producing a full CCN spectrum every hour. The raw CCN measurements are filtered to discount periods of transient operation and whenever the room temperature housing the instrument changed sufficiently to induce a reset in column temperature. Additional information can be found in Section 2.1.2 [here](https://acp.copernicus.org/preprints/acp-2020-1036/).\r\n\r\n__Hygroscopicity data:__ The CCN number concentration measurements were directly related to the size distribution and total aerosol concentration data measured by the Scanning Mobility Particle Size Spectrometer (SMPS) instrument at the same station (https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/aerosol-data-weissfluhjoch) to infer the particles hygroscopicity parameter (kappa). For each SMPS scan, the particles critical dry diameter (Dcr) is estimated by integrating backward the SMPS size distribution, until the aerosol number matches the CCN concentration observed for the same time period as the SMPS scan. Assuming the particle chemical composition is internally mixed, the kappa is determined from Dcr and SS, applying Köhler theory. Additional information can be found in Section 2.2 [here](https://acp.copernicus.org/preprints/acp-2020-1036/).\r\n\r\n__Predicted cloud droplet numbers:__ Droplet calculations are carried out with the physically based aerosol activation parameterization of Morales and Nenes (2014), employing the “characteristic velocity” approach of Morales and Nenes (2010). Aerosol size distribution observations required to predict the cloud droplet numbers and maximum in-cloud supersaturation are obtained from the SMPS instrument deployed at Weissfluhjoch. The required vertical velocity measurements are derived from the wind Doppler Lidar (https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/lidar-wind-profiler-data) deployed at Davos Wolfgang and are extracted for the altitude of interest, being 1100 m above ground level for Weissfluhjoch. Additional information can be found in Section 2.3 [here](https://acp.copernicus.org/preprints/acp-2020-1036/).\r\n\r\n",

      "description": "Remote sensing instruments providing information on aerosols, radiation, and clouds were deployed in Davos Wolfgang, 1630 m above sea level (a.s.l), and Kloster, 1150 m a.s.l for the duration of the [RACLETS](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/raclets-field-campaign) campaign. The instruments were owned and supervised by ETH Zürich, Meteoswiss, and TROPOS Leipzig. \r\n\r\nAt Davos Wolfgang, a CloudNet station combined a Raman Lidar (Polly-XT), a Doppler Cloud Radar (Mira-36, METEK GmbH) and a Microwave Radiometer (RPG-HATPRO, Radiometer Physics GmbH) to measure aerosol and cloud properties. In addition, a Doppler Lidar (Windcube 100S, Leosphere) and a Radar Wind Profiler were deployed to get information on wind properties like direction (°), speed (m s&#713;&#185;) and vertical profile (up to 5000 m above ground). The tethered balloon system carrying a holographic imager, named [HoloBalloon](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/clouds-in-situ-raclets) to measure cloud microphysics, was launched close to the CloudNet station. \r\nA Ceilometer (CL31, Vaisala), which was deployed in Kloster, reported the cloud base height (m a.s.l.) and vertical visibility (m).\r\nQuicklooks of the measurements and more information on the instruments can be found here: http://data.iac.ethz.ch/holodavos2019/\r\n\r\n![imahge is missing](https://iacweb.ethz.ch/data/holimo/images/notUploaded/Annika/DSC_4599_Scale.jpg)\r\n\r\nImage 1: LIDAR laser and HoloBalloon at Davos Wolfgang. &#169; Annika Lauber \r\n\r\n![image is missing](https://iacweb.ethz.ch/data/holimo/images/notUploaded/Jan/IMG_20190210_201419_Scale.jpg)\r\n\r\nImage 2: CloudNet Station from TROPOS e.V., housing the LIDAR system at Davos Wolfgang. &#169; Jan Hennerbger\r\n\r\n![image is missing](https://iacweb.ethz.ch/data/holimo/images/notUploaded/Jan/IMG_20190209_103309_Scale.jpg)\r\n\r\nImage 3: Measurement site at Davos Wolfang at daytime showing Doppler Lidar, Radar Wind Profiler, the CloudNET station and the measurement container containing aerosol instruments . &#169; Jan Hennerbger\r\n",

Our activities are aimed at the determination of optical and physical properties of aerosols and clouds as well as at the assesment of the general atmospheric state parameters (temperature, wind, moisture).\r\nThe working group has conducted more than 15 field experiments in key regions of climate research where it applies its techniques to understand the role of aerosols and clouds in the climate system. During RACLETS, the ground-based remote sensing working group participated with observations of the mobile Oceanet platform, which is usually deployed during cruises of the research vessel Polarstern. Oceanet carries a multiwavelength Raman polarization lidar and a microwave radiometer as well as standard meteorological sensors. During RACLETS, a 35-GHz cloud radar and a disdrometer were deployed in addition. This equipment was used to process synergies of the remote sensing observations via Cloudnet (http://cloudnet.fmi.fi).\r\n\r\nMore information on: https://www.tropos.de/en/institute/departments/remote-sensing-of-atmospheric-processes-new/ground-based-remote-sensing",

      "description": "Comparing aerial images, taken at different time periods, is a quick and cost-effective way to quickly detect landscape changes. This allows monitoring all sites of national importance on a regular basis. During the first phase of the project (2012 to 2017), the state of the habitats at the times the inventories were compiled (1980s and 1990s) has been compared. The interpretation is done manually on a 3D screen. The images from the 1980s and 1990s are in black and white, whereas the contemporary images are false color infrared stereo images.\r\nTo ensure reproducibility of the interpretation and location of changes within the sites, a grid of 50m x 50 m cells was placed over each site. Within each grid cell, simple indicators such as changes in tree and shrub cover or infrastructures such as roads and buildings are recorded using an ordinal scale with 11 classes (1 ≙ <0%, 2 ≙ 1–10%, 3 ≙ 11–20%, 4 ≙ 21–30%, 5 ≙ 31–40%, 6 ≙ 41–50%, 7 ≙ 51–60%, 8 ≙ 61–70%, 9 ≙ 71–80%, 10 ≙ 81–90%, 11 ≙ 91–100% cover). This allows a quick interpretation of changes, e.g., abandonment (by shrub encroachment). The centers of the grid cells correspond to the interpreted points of the Swiss Land-Use and Land-Cover Statistics and the Swiss National Forest Inventory (NFI). \r\nBased on these data, an online color-coded warning system has been established to ensure early detection of negative changes and to conduct prompt conservation measures. This tool can be assessed by the responsible federal and cantonal conservation authorities.\r\nThe very laborious field surveys are conducted in a subsample of all sites. Vegetation changes in fens, bogs, dry grasslands, riparian areas and flood plains are interpreted using diversity and compositional measures. The regular sampling of amphibian species and their population-size classes reflect temporal changes in amphibian breeding sites.\r\nIn addition, remote-sensing methods are developed to automatically calculate as many features as possible that are important for the quality of habitats of national importance. One example is shrub encroachment, which is calculated from the canopy height models obtained from the 3D aerial image data.\r\n",

          "notes": "Switzerland has a reliable and cost efficient energy system. Due to phase  out of nuclear energy it is necessary to find new options to maintain this powerful energy system. The Swiss energy strategy 2050 aims to reduce CO2-emissions, increase efficiency and promote renewable energies. The Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) examined relevant woody and non-woody biomass quantities (cubic meters, fresh-, dry weight) and their energy potentials (in Petajoules: primary energy and biomethane) with a similar methodological approach. The work was done within the frame of the Swiss Competence Centers for Energy Research (SCCER) especially in line with the SCCER Biomass for Swiss energy future (Biosweet). With a uniform and consistent approach for the current potentials ten biomass categories were estimated and aggregated for the whole of Switzerland. In this context solutions for the technical, social and political challenges are promoted. First, considering the different biomass resources characteristics and available data, appropriate methods at the finest scale possible were elaborated to estimate the annual quantities which could theoretically be collected (theoretical potential). Then, explicit and rational restrictions for sustainable bio-energy production were defined according to the current state of the art and subtracted from the theoretical potential to obtain the sustainable potential. The main restrictions are competing material utilizations, environmental factors and supply costs. Finally, the additional sustainable potential was estimated considering the current bioenergy production. Our main purpose was to provide potentials for developing conversion technologies as well as a detailed and comprehensive basis of the Swiss biomass potentials for energy use for economic and political decision makers.

          "notes": "Decomposition of plant litter is a key process for the transfer of carbon and nutrients in ecosystems. Carbon contained in the decaying biomass is released to the atmosphere as respired CO2, and may contribute to global warming. Litterbag studies have been used to improve our knowledge of the drivers of litter decomposition, but they lack comparability because litter quality is plant species-specific. The use of commercial tea bags as a standard substrate was suggested in order to harmonize studies, where green tea and rooibos represent more labile and more recalcitrant C compounds as surrogates of local litter.\r\nThe tea bag approach was implemented on eight sites of the Swiss long-term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) network (https://www.wsl.ch/LWF). This allowed us to take advantage from the existing infrastructure and data from a previous litterbag study with local litter. In Beatenberg and Schaenis, additional elevation transects were established (1200-1800 m and 540-1150 m, respectively) to examine particularly the effect of temperature on decomposition. In Pfynwald (https://www.wsl.ch/de/ueber-die-wsl/versuchsanlagen-und-labors/flaechen-im-wald/pfynwald.html) and Salgesch, infrastructure of running projects was used to examine the effect of drought and understory removal, respectively. In Novaggio, tea bags were incubated in summer and winter to study the effect of seasonality particularly precipitation. Tea bags are collected after 3, 12, 24, and 36 months; for the two time-shifted experiments additionally after 6 and 9 months.\r\nThe study has two primary objectives. Firstly, it contributes to TeaComposition initiative (http://teacomposition.org/) which aims at investigating long-term litter decomposition and its key drivers at present as well as under different future climate scenarios using a common protocol and standard litter (tea) across nine terrestrial biomes. Secondly, the data are used to further develop decomposition models such as Yasso (http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/yasso) which is used by several countries, including Switzerland to estimate the annual carbon fluxes in dead wood, litter, and soil for reporting in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol.\r\n",

The experiment is located in a xeric mature Scots pine forest in the Pfynwald (46° 18' N, 7° 36' E, 615 m a.s.l.) in one of the driest inner-Alpine valleys of the European Alps, the Valais (mean annual temperature: 9.2°C, annual precipitation sum: 657 mm, both 1961-1990). Tree age is on average 100 years, the top height is 10.8 m and the stand density is 730 stems ha-1 with a basal area of 27.3 m2 ha-1. The forest is described as _Erico Pinetum sylvestris_ and the soil is a shallow pararendzina characterized by low water retention. The experimental site (1.2 ha; 800 trees) is split up into eight plots of 1'000 m2 each. During April-October, irrigation is applied on four randomly selected plots with sprinklers of 1 m height at night using water from an adjacent water channel. The amount of irrigation corresponds to a supplementary rainfall of 700 mm year-1. Trees in the other four plots grow under naturally dry conditions. Soil moisture has been monitored since the beginning of the project at 3 soil depths (10, 20 and 60 cm). The crown condition of each tree is being assessed each year since 2003. Tree measurement data such as diameter at breast height, tree height, and social status were assessed in 2002, 2009 and 2014. The duration of the irrigation experiment is planned for 20 years.",

Seehronwald Davos site is dedicated to forest ecosystem research with current projects focusing on topics of climate change, ecosystem carbon balance, ecophysiology, vegetation and soil sciences. The site belongs to one of the best equipped long-term forest ecology research sites of the world. Time series of climate variables, ecosystem gas exchange (eddy covariance), tree physiology records (sap flow, stem radius changes), and air pollution data cover the history of this site over more than 20 years. Records of local climate variables started in 1876. Since 2013 the site is part of [ICOS](https://www.icos-cp.eu), which awarded the infrastructure the CLASS 1 label on 21 November 2019. The site is part of the following national and international networks and encourages further synergistic collaborations with scientists from all over the world: \r\n\r\n* National Air Pollution Monitoring Network ([NABEL](https://www.empa.ch/web/s503/nabel))\r\n* ICOS Switzerland ([ICOS-CH](https://www.icos-switzerland.ch/davos))\r\n* [TreeNet](https://treenet.info/switzerland/davos): The biological drought and growth indicator network\r\n* Long-term Forest Ecosystem Research ([LWF](https://www.wsl.ch/en/forest/forest-development-and-monitoring/long-term-forest-ecosystem-research-lwf/sites/davos.html))\r\n* [Swiss FluxNet](https://www.swissfluxnet.ethz.ch/index.php/sites/ch-dav-davos/site-info-ch-dav)\r\n* Ecosystem Research ([ExpeER](http://www.expeeronline.eu/43-expeer-ta-sites/131-davos-seehornwald-switzerland.html))\r\n* Long Term Ecological Research ([LTER](https://www.lter-europe.net))\r\n* [ICP Forests](http://icp-forests.net): the International Co-operative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests\r\n\r\nThe site measurements are jointly run by the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology ([EMPA](https://www.empa.ch)), the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich ([ETHZ](https://www.gl.ethz.ch)), and the Swiss Federal Research Institute ([WSL](https://www.wsl.ch)) in Birmensdorf and Davos.

          "notes": "The IAP has been monitoring forest health since 1984 on behalf of cantonal forest and environmental offices and in collaboration with the Federal Office for the Environment. In the Intercantonal Forest Observation Program (WDB) project, the health, growth and nutrient supply of beech, spruce and oak in managed forest ecosystems are studied on about 190 forest plots. The plots cover the most important gradients of Swiss forests, such as different climatic conditions in precipitation, temperature, as well as differences in soil and in the input of air pollutants such as nitrogen and ozone. Currently (date 2020) 94 plots with 6268 beech trees, 75 plots with 4547 spruce trees, and 50 plots with 1858 oak trees are surveyed in the Intercantonal WDB. Annual investigations include crown condition and tree loss by mortality, uprooting and stem breakage. Every 4 year stem increment is measured on all 12’673 trees and 8 branches are harvested by helicopter very 4 years and subsequently examined for the following parameters:\r\n\r\n- Nutrient analysis in foliage (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Mn)\r\n- Leaf area and weight\r\n- Shoot growth (retrospective for Norway spruce, beech and oak)\r\n- Discoloration and parasite infestation\r\n- Fructification of beech (retrospectively)\r\n\t\r\nIn addition, soil samples for analysing the chemistry of the solid phase are taken every 12 years. Also changes in the ground vegetation is assessed every 12 years. On a subset of the plots soil solution is sampled monthly *[(Soil solution monitoring of the Intercantonal Forest Observation Program)](https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/soil-solution-monitoring-of-the-intercantonal-forest-observation-program)*. In addition, soil water potential and soil moisture are measured in a subset of sites of the Intercantonal Forest Observation Program *[(Soil moisture and soil water potential measurements of the Intercantonal Forest Observation Program)](https://www.envidat.ch/dataset/soil-water-measurements-wdb)*.\r\n\r\nThese data allow to gain a unique understanding of the main factors influencing the forest and the most important changes, which are very valuable especially in the context of climate change. The insights are of great importance for cantonal and regional forest planning as well as for national and international determinations of critical loads and limits (e.g. CLempN, UNECE CLRTAP).",

In light of this, a WSL research team installed a long-term experiment of 20 years duration in the Pfyn forest.  The average temperature here is 9.2°C, the yearly accumulated precipitation is 657 mm (average 1961-1990). The pines in the middle of the forest are about 100 years old and 10.8 m high. The test area has 876 trees covering 1.2 ha divided into 8 plots of 1'000 m2 each. Between the months of April and October, four of these plots are irrigated by a sprinkler system providing an additional 700 mm of water, annually. In the other four plots, the trees grow under natural, hence relatively dry conditions.",

We examine these effects as part of the Long-Term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme.__\r\n\r\nWe need reliable information in order to record the condition of the forest on an ongoing basis and to understand precisely what happens in the forest when the environment changes. An important source of data here is the Long-Term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme. It consists of 19 permanent monitoring sites on which we have regularly carried out numerous measurements since 1994. We have also been recording the health of trees on the monitoring sites of the Sanasilva Inventory, which is part of the LWF programme (see Sites), since 1985.\r\n\r\nWe disclose the gathered data, as well as the scientific interpretation of this data, to national and international decision-makers.\r\n\r\nWith the legally enshrined functions of the LWF programme, Switzerland participates in international research programmes such as the \"International Co-operative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests\" ICP Forests and the LTER-Europe Network (Long-Term Ecosystem Research in Europe).\r\n\r\nThe Long-term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) programme is run and financed by the WSL.\r\n \r\n### Objectives of the programme\r\n\r\n *   Early detection and a representative assessment of changes in forest condition\r\n *   Determination of external influences, both from anthropogenic and natural sources and their effect on the forest ecosystem (element inputs, climate)\r\n *    Determination of changes in important components within the forest ecosystem\r\n *   Development of indicators to assess the condition of the forest\r\n *   Integrated risk assessment based on different stress scenarios\r\n *   Extended platform for internal and external research projects\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/forest/forest-development-and-monitoring/long-term-forest-ecosystem-research-lwf.html",

We simulated environmental constraints on growth fusing 3-PG model or the species’ potential distribution range within the forested area of Switzerland on a 1×1 km grid for seven dominant tree species: _Larix decidua_, _Picea abies_, _Abies alba_, _Fagus sylvatica_, _Acer pseudoplatanus_, _Pinus sylvestris_, and _Quercus robur_. For this purpose, we simulated the growth of these tree species in monocultures with the average climate observed during 1961–1990 or 1991-2018. The stands were initialized as 2-year-old plantations with an initial density of 2,500 trees ha-1 and simulated until the age of 30 years. For each simulated month, we obtained the relative contribution of environmental constraints (VPD, temperature, and soil water) on tree growth. ",

          "notes": "# Background information\r\nClimate change-induced range expansion of treeline populations depends on their successful recruitment, which requires dispersal of viable seeds followed by successful establishment of individual propagules. The Global Treeline Range Expansion Experiment (G-TREE) is a global initiative involving researchers from Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand (Brown et al., 2013). At 15 alpine and Arctic treeline sites worldwide the mechanisms determining the elevational and latitudinal distribution of tree populations are studied using a standardized experimental approach. In summer 2013, a multifactorial seedling recruitment experiment has been established at the Stillberg ecological treeline research site. The aim of this experiment, is to quantify the effect of multiple abiotic and biotic drivers on emergence, survival, and growth of *Larix decidua* and *Picea abies* seedlings in replicated plots along an elevation gradient with three sites below (1930 m a.s.l.), at (2090 m a.s.l.), and above treeline (2410 m a.s.l.; Frei et al., 2018). All plots have been surveyed annually to count seedlings and to measure their total height. Additional environmental factors, such as soil temperature, have been recorded. \r\n\r\n# Experimental design\r\nThe Stillberg research area is located in the Eastern Swiss Alps near Davos, Switzerland. The site has been used for several long-term monitoring as well as experimental studies for the last four decades. Our G-TREE experiment consists of a lowest site located in a subalpine Larch-Spruce forest (*Larici-Picetum*) dominated by *Larix decidua* and *Picea abies* (1930 m a.s.l.), a transition zone site dominated by alpine shrubs (2100 m a.s.l.), and an uppermost site in an alpine meadow with some dwarf shrubs (2390 m a.s.l.). The three experimental sites were set up following the standard protocol of the global G-TREE initiative (Brown et al., 2013). In a split-plot design, 20 plots (224 cm × 45 cm) were established at each site, which were randomly assigned to the 2 × 2 treatment combinations of the main factors seeding and scarification (i.e. seeding and scarification, seeding only, scarification only, and full control), resulting in five replications per main treatment combination. Each plot was divided into 16 split-plots (22.5 cm × 28 cm), to which treatment combinations of four additional two-level factors species (larch and spruce), provenance (low- and high-elevation), herbivore exclosure (with and without exclosure), and seeding year (2013, 2014) were randomly assigned, which resulted in a total of 960 split-plots (Details see Frei et al. 2018). \r\n\r\n# Data description\r\nAll plots have been surveyed annually to count seedlings and to measure their total height. Seedling height was assessed with a hand ruler as the total length from the original emerging point to the apical meristem (Details see Frei et al. 2018). Additionally, soil temperature at each site, has been continuously recorded since 2013. Here, we present data from eight years (2013–2021).",

However, they may react sensitively to changes of climate, land-use and disturbance regimes. Activities of the group focus on mountain ecosystems above and below the treeline (mountain forest, alpine ecosystems) and represent links between ecosystem research of WSL and snow and avalanche topics of the SLF in Davos.\r\n\r\n__Further information__: https://www.wsl.ch/en/about-wsl/organization/research-units/community-ecology/mountain-ecosystems.html",

          "notes": "# Background information\r\n\r\nHigh elevation ecosystems are important in research about environmental change because shifts in climate associated with anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are predicted to be more pronounced in these areas compared to most other regions of the world. This project involved a Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) and soil warming experiment located in a natural treeline environment near Davos, Switzerland (Stillberg, 2200 m a.s.l.). Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (+200 ppm) were applied from 2001 until 2009, and a soil warming treatment (+4 °C) was applied from 2007 until 2012. The combined CO2 enrichment and warming treatment reflects conditions expected to occur in this region in approximately 2050. A broad range of ecological and biogeochemical research was carried out as part of this environmental change project.\r\n\r\n# Experimental design\r\n\r\nThe experiment consisted of 40 hexagonal 1.1 m² plots, 20 with a *Pinus mugo* ssp. *uncinata* (mountain pine, evergreen) individual in the centre and 20 with a *Larix decidua* (European larch, deciduous) individual in the centre. A dense cover of understorey vegetation surrounded the tree in each plot, including the dominant dwarf shrub species *Vaccinium myrtillus* (bilberry), *Vaccinium gaultherioides* (group *V. uliginosum agg.*, northern bilberry) and *Empetrum nigrum* ssp. *hermaphroditum* (crowberry) plus several herbaceous and non-vascular species.\r\nAt the beginning of the experimental period, the 40 plots were assigned to ten groups of four neighbouring plots (two larch and two pine trees per group) in order to facilitate the logistics of CO2 distribution and regulation. Half of these groups were randomly assigned to an elevated CO2 treatment, while the remaining groups served as controls and received no additional CO2. In spring 2007, one plot of each tree species identity was randomly selected from each of the 10 CO2 treatment groups and assigned a soil warming treatment, yielding a balanced design with a replication of five individual plots for each combination of CO2 level, warming treatment and tree species.\r\n\r\n# Data description\r\n\r\nSoil and air conditions have been monitored closely throughout the study period, with most measurements made during the combined CO2 x warming experiment (2007-2009). The data comprise of air temperature, soil temperature, soil moisture, sapflow, tree diameter and CO2 measurements.",

          "notes": "# Background information\r\n\r\nThe availability of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) is considered to be a major factor limiting growth and productivity in terrestrial ecosystems globally. This project aimed to determine whether the growth stimulation documented in previous short‐term fertilisation trials persisted in a longer‐term study (12 years) in the treeline ecotone, and whether possible negative effects of nutrient addition offset the benefits of any growth stimulation. \r\nOver the course of the 12 study years, NPK fertiliser corresponding to 15 or 30 kg N ha−1 a−1 was added annually to plots containing 30‐year‐old *Larix decidua* or 32‐year-old *Pinus uncinata* individuals with an understorey of mainly ericaceous dwarf shrubs. To quantify growth, annual shoot increments of trees and dwarf shrubs as well as radial growth increments of trees were measured. Nutrient concentrations in the soil were also measured and the foliar nutritional status of trees and dwarf shrubs was assessed.\r\n\r\n# Experimental design\r\n\r\nOver an elevation gradient of 140 m across the treeline afforestation site Stillberg, 22 locations were chosen that covered the whole range of microenvironmental conditions (*see* Nutrient addition experimental design.png). Half of the blocks included European larch (*L. decidua*) and the other half included mountain pine (*P. uncinata*). Within each block, three plantation quadrats were randomly selected as experimental plots and each plot was assigned to a control (no fertilisation) or to one of two fertiliser dose treatments (15 kg and 30 kg N ha−1 a−1). Treatments were assigned randomly but confined so that the location of fertilised plots within a block was not directly above control plots to avoid nutrient input from drainage. For details about the experiment, *see* Möhl et al (2019).\r\n\r\n# Data description\r\n\r\nThe available datasets contain climate variables (2004-2016), nutrient isotope measurements (2010 & 2016), shrub growth measurements (2004-2016), soil parameter measurements and annual ring and shoot measurements (2004-2016).

          "notes": "# Background information\r\n\r\nThe Stillberg ecological treeline research site in the Swiss Alps was established in 1975, with the aim to develop ecologically, technically, and economically sustainable reforestation techniques at the treeline to reduce the risk of snow avalanches. In the course of time, additional research aspects gained importance, such as the ecology of the treeline ecotone under global change. Long-term monitoring of the large-scale high-elevation afforestation has generated data about tree growth, survival, and vitality. In addition, detailed characteristics of the microsite conditions of the research were conducted. Besides providing a scientific basis and practical guidelines for high-elevation afforestation, this research has contributed to a comprehensive understanding of ecological processes in the treeline ecotone. \r\n\r\n# Experiment description\r\n\r\nThe Stillberg afforestation experiment was established in 1975 by planting 92,000 seedlings of *Larix decidua*, *Pinus cembra* and *Pinus mugo* ssp. *uncinata* in the alpine treeline ecotone. The afforestation site is located on a northeast-facing slope with steep, topographically highly structured terrain and covers elevations from 2075 to 2230 m a.s.l. The afforestation site was divided into 4052 square plots of 3.5 × 3.5 m, arranged in a regular species-alternating pattern over the whole area. Each plot contained 25 trees of one species (1350 plots per species), and the seedlings were systematically planted 70 cm apart. The trees have been monitored since 1975. Specifically, tree mortality was assessed annually from 1975 until 1995 and has been documented every ten years since then, with surveys in 2005 and 2015 (the next survey is due in 2025). Height of the surviving trees was measured in 1975, 1979, 1982, 1985, 1990, 1995, 2005, and 2015. In 1995, 2005, and 2015, drivers of tree vitality were assessed for a subset of trees per plot. Additionally, an extensive set of environmental parameters characterizing microsite conditions of the afforestation area were recorded before and after the planting of the trees. \r\n\r\n# Data description\r\n\r\nThe five datasets from the afforestation experiment comprise ecological and environmental data from the main afforestation experiment in five datasets with accompanying metadata (Stillberg_afforestation_all_metadata.xlsx). All data and metadata files are bundled in a ZIP-file (Stillberg_afforestation_v1.zip). In particular, a first dataset contains environmental data characterising microsite conditions of the 4000 plots with regard to soil, topography, vegetation and microclimatic conditions (Stillberg_afforestation_plot_data_v1.csv; Stillberg_afforestation_plot_metadata_v1.csv. In each plot, the natural tree regeneration was assessed by counting seedings of several tree species in 2005 and 2015 (Stillberg_afforestation_regeneration_data_v1.csv; Stillberg_afforestation_regeneration_metadata_v1.csv). Furthermore, specific information about each of the 92’000 planted trees of the tree species is available (Stillberg_afforestation_tree_parameter_data_v1.csv; Stillberg_afforestation_tree_parameter_metadata_v1.csv). Survival data for each of the 92’000 individual trees can be found in a separate dataset (Stillberg_afforestation_tree_survival_data_v1.csv; Stillberg_afforestation_tree_survival_metadata_v1.csv). Tree growth and vitality parameters are available for all trees from 1995, and for subsets of trees for 2005 and 2015 (Stillberg_afforestation_tree_measurements_data_v1.csv; Stillberg_afforestation_tree_measurements_metadata_v1.csv).\r\n",

In the course of time, additional research aspects gained importance, such as the ecology of the treeline ecotone under global change. Over almost fifty years, research at the Stillberg site combined long-term monitoring of the large-scale high-elevation afforestation with experimental manipulations simulating global change impacts. Besides providing a scientific basis and practical guidelines for high-elevation afforestation, this research has contributed to a comprehensive understanding of ecological processes in the treeline ecotone across different compartments and scales, from individual trees, non-tree vegetation and soils to whole ecosystems, in the context of global change resulting in more than 150 publications. \r\n\r\n# Dataset generation\r\n\r\nWe compiled a comprehensive list of scientific publications covering research at the Stillberg research site by conducting searches in the literature databases Web of Science and Google Scholar, as well as in the Digital Object Repository of the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL (DORA). We compiled all publications about the afforestation experiment, the FACE × warming experiment, the nutrient addition experiment, the G-TREE experiment, as well as other studies related to the Stillberg research site.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Data description\r\n\r\nThe Stillberg bibliography (Stillberg_bibliography_data_v1.csv) comprises a comprehensive list of 276 scientific publications, 91 of them published in peer-reviewed ISI journals. Currently the bibliography comprises literature about the main afforestation experiment, the FACE × warming experiment, the nutrient addition experiment, and the G-TREE experiment, as well as further publications related to the Stillberg research site that have been published until August 2023. The bibliography can be filtered for different categories, e.g., experiment, peer-review, source repository or database, and source title. The bibliography is described in a metadata file (Stillberg_bibliography_metadata_v1.csv). The bibliography along with the metadata file are provided in a ZIP-folder (Stillberg_bibliography_v1.zip).",

          "notes": "# Background information\r\nThe Stillberg ecological treeline research site is located in the transition zone between the relatively humid climate of the Northern Alps and the continental climate of the Central Alps. In 1975, 92,000 seedlings of the high-elevation conifer species *Larix decidua* Mill. (European larch), *Pinus cembra* L. (Cembran pine), and *Pinus mugo* ssp. *uncinata* (DC.) Domin (mountain pine) were systematically planted across an area of 5 hectares along an elevation gradient of about 150 metres, with the aim to develop ecologically, technically, and economically sustainable afforestation techniques at the treeline to reduce the risk of snow avalanches. In the course of time, additional research aspects gained importance, such as the ecology of the treeline ecotone under global change. Alongside the ecological long-term monitoring of the afforestation, several meteorological stations have recorded local meteorological conditions at the Stillberg research site. Here, we provide the Davos Stillberg meteorological timeseries of five stations from 1975 (01-01-1975), the year of the afforestation establishment, until the end of the year 2022 (31-12-2022).\r\n\r\n#  Station description\r\nThe five meteorological stations were all installed at the same location (46°46′25.015″N 9°52′01.792″E) at 2090 m a.s.l., in the lower part of the afforestation area. In general, the five stations were operated sequentially (Stillberg_meteo_metadata_stations_v1.csv). However, there are some overlapping time periods when more than one station was operated in parallel. The stations have recorded environmental parameters, such as air and soil temperature, dew point temperature, air pressure, relative humidity, wind direction and velocity, radiation, precipitation, and snow depth (Stillberg_meteo_metadata_parameters_v1.csv). The meteorological measurements were recorded hourly from 1975 until 1996 and have been recorded in 10-minute intervals since 1997.\r\n\r\n# Data description\r\nWe processed the Davos Stillberg meteorological timeseries with the MeteoIO meteorological data pre-processing library (Bavay & Egger, 2014). Data files are provided for each station and quality level separately and named according to the station (see ‘Stillberg_meteo_metadata_stations_v1.csv’). From the raw data in their original formats, we generated three data quality levels: raw standardized (folder ‘raw_standardized’), edited (folder ‘raw_edited’) and filtered (folder ‘filtered’). The processing level is indicated in the headers of the data files. The whole processing protocol is described in a set of human-readable configuration files that are used by MeteoIO to generate the required data quality levels. This improves long-term reproducibility (Bavay et al., 2022), as the data could be regenerated in the future, even using a completely different software, to account for additional data points or to introduce new data corrections. The first quality level (raw standardized) is generated by parsing the original data files and interpreting them in order to convert all data points to a common format and meteorological parameter naming scheme, while excluding unreadable or duplicated data lines. The generated data files are derivatives of CSV files, with a standardised header that contains the metadata that are necessary to interpret and use the data (use metadata) and to populate a data index (search metadata). The latter is a textual implementation of the Attribute Convention for Data Discovery (ACDD) metadata standard (Attribute Convention for Data Discovery 1-3, 2022). The second quality level (edited) builds on the raw data by performing low-level data editing, such as removing some data periods that are known to be unusable (often based on maintenance records or anecdotal evidence) or applying undocumented calibration factors (for example, when there seems to be an obvious offset on a measured parameter for a period between two documented maintenance operations). The third quality level is generated by applying statistical filters on the data (per station and per meteorological parameter) to exclude presumably wrong values. We did not perform gap filling, as no single strategy could be relied upon that would work best for all possible data usage scenarios.",

      "description": "The sub-sample of all sites of national importance was selected using a stratified random sampling design, weighting rare vegetation types higher than common ones to ensure a more evenly representation of vegetation types among bio-geographical regions and along elevational gradients. The sample includes approximately 400 dry grassland sites, 260 bogs and fens, and 125 riparian areas and flood plains of national importance. In total, more than 7000 permanently marked circular 10 m2 plots were established in the first sampling period from (2011 to 2017). In all these plots all vascular plants are sampled every six years. In addition, in riparian areas and flood plains, shrubs and trees are sampled in a second 200 m2 plot (concentric with the 10 m2 plot). In fens and bogs, beside vascular plants soil-dwelling bryophytes (i.e. mosses, liverworts, hornworts) are recorded. \r\nThe floristic data is also transferred to the national data centers, i.e. Info Flora (National data center of the Swiss flora) and Swiss Bryophytes (National data center of Swiss bryophytes) and used for other national projects, such as the national Red List of Endangered species programs. In addition, data are available for specific research projects on request. \r\nUsing the same sampling methods in all habitat types allows the comparison among vegetation types. Moreover, these methods correspond to the ones of other national monitoring programs, i.e., the Swiss Biodiversity Monitoring (BDM) and the agro-environmental monitoring (ALL-EMA). The three monitoring projects complement each other perfectly. While BDM reflects a random picture of the ‘normal landscape’ of Switzerland (including settlements) and ALL-EMA covers a wide range of (mesic) agriculturally used grasslands with different land-use intensities, WBS mirrors rare vegetation types with diverse ecological conditions, i.e. protected areas from dry steppe habitat types in the inner-alpine dry valleys over dry to mesic agriculturally used grasslands to wetlands, fens and bogs. Thus, the whole ecological and land-use intensity gradient of various habitat types in Switzerland is covered, allowing synthesis analyses to answer more general questions.\r\n",

      "description": "The institute's former main building on the Weissfluhjoch remains at its disposal for research purposes. The test site below the building is the [SLF's](http://www.envidat.ch/organization/slf) oldest and equipped with numerous measuring instruments.\r\n\r\n## Globally unrivalled serial measurements\r\nIn autumn 1936, the Expert Commission for Snow and Avalanche Research (now the SLF) in Switzerland built the first snow laboratory on the Weissfluhjoch. Since these early days, SLF employees have been observing the weather and snow conditions on the adjacent test site daily. The site is located on a flat area of the Dorftälli, approximately 150 m below the Weissfluhjoch towards Davos, at an altitude of 2540 m. In view of the good accessibility and the numerous avalanche-prone slopes in the vicinity, researchers have conducted countless major experiments and studies here in the fields of snow mechanics, snow metamorphism, snow characterisation and measuring methodology. They have also tested the prototypes of various instruments, calibrated remote sensing products, and used the data collected at the test site to compare their snowpack models with those of other scholars.\r\nThe Weissfluhjoch test site is now the only one in the world at this altitude that has a daily record of snow depths and snowfall dating back more than 70 years.\r\n\r\n__More information:__ http://www.slf.ch/ueber/standorte/weissfluhjoch/index_EN",
