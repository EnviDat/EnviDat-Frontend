The second measurement site for aerosol particles was on a mountain site, called Weissfluhjoch (LON: 9.806475, LAT: 46.832964), at an elevation of 2700 m a.s.l. The instruments were owned and operated by ETH Zurich and University of Basel. \r\n\r\nThe aerosol size spectra from 15 nm to 40 &#956; m were recorded with a combination of SMPS (model 3938, TSI Inc.), APS (model 3321, TSI Inc.), and OPCs (OPC-N3, Alphasense ; GT-526S Met One Instruments, Inc.).\r\nIn-situ measurements of Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) were carried out with a CCN chamber (CCNC, Droplet Measurement Technologies). LINDA (LED based Ice Nucleation Detection Aparatus, University of Basel), DRINCZ (Droplet Ice Nuclei Counter Zurich, ETH Zurich), and a cold stage were used to investigate ice nucleating particle (INP) concentrations by drop freezing experiments. Information about the secondary ice fraction was gained by melting and re-freezing single dendrites. For further chemical analysis, particles larger than 0.5 &#956;m were collected with an air sampler (Coriolis &#956;, bertin Instruments) using a cyclone technology to separate particles from the air into the sample liquid. \r\n\r\nInformation on [precipitation](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/precipitation), [wind](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/remote-sensing-raclets), [meteorological parameters](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/meteorology), [cloud properties](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/remote-sensing-raclets) and [cloud composition](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/clouds-in-situ-raclets) were gained at the valley station.

Additionally, a present weather detector (PWD22, Vaisala) was installed at Klosters to measure the weather type, ambient ligth as well as intensity and amount of both liquid and solid precipitation (mm). \r\n\r\nRadiosondes were started in Davos Wolfgang to report height profiles of pressure, relative humidity and temperature.\r\nFurther profiles of meteorological measures were recorded at [HoloGondel](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/clouds-in-situ-raclets), which was installed at the gondola moving between Gotschnaboden and Gotschnagrat at 2285 m a.s.l.\r\n\r\n![image is missing](https://iacweb.ethz.ch/data/holimo/images/notUploaded/Claudia/P2121953_Scale.JPG)\r\n\r\nImage: Claudia Mignani", "image_display_url": "https://www.envidat.ch/uploads/group/2019-08-21-120017.589162RACLETSmeteologo.png", "package_count": 6, "created": "2019-07-11T14:04:31.578927", "name": "meteorology", "is_organization": false, "state": "active", "extras": [{"value": "RACLETS Field Campaign", "state": "active", "key": "parent", "revision_id": "e0e66916-a877-4cf9-93e3-9b4174d131bb", "group_id": "14176f90-0058-4679-b328-0c14b513cf22", "id": "fd9ad5ba-b9b0-48f8-a519-761863bc04aa"}], "image_url": "2019-08-21-120017.589162RACLETSmeteologo.png", "groups": [], "type": "group", "title": "Meteorology", "revision_id": "5d57ea6b-656d-4843-bd99-cb2ba4e8e469", "packages": [{"owner_org": "677814d4-baab-47c2-ba03-8f34882de3cc", "maintainer": "{\"affiliation\": \"ETH Z\u00fcrich\", \"identifier\": \"\", \"given_name\": \"\", \"name\": \"J\u00f6rg Wieder\", \"email\": \"joerg.wieder@env.ethz.ch\"}", "relationships_as_object": [], "private": false, "maintainer_email": null, "num_tags": 8, "subtitle": "", "id": "f6c38c8c-ab20-43a6-ae37-82117733df96", "metadata_created": "2019-10-15T12:10:50.529170", "funding": "[{\"grant_number\": \"\", \"institution\": \"SNF\", \"institution_url\": \"\"}]", "publication": "{\"publisher\": \"EnviDat\", \"publication_year\": \"2019\"}", "metadata_modified": "2020-06-10T09:55:55.551419", "author": "[{\"name\": \"Wieder\", \"data_credit\": \"collection\", \"affiliation\": \"ETH Z\u00fcrich\", \"affiliation_03\": \"\", \"given_name\": \"J\u00f6rg\", \"identifier\": \"\", \"email\": \"joerg.wieder@env.ethz.ch\", \"affiliation_02\": \"\"}, {\"name\": \"R\u00f6sch\", \"data_credit\": \"curation\", \"affiliation\": \"ETH Z\u00fcrich\", \"affiliation_03\": \"\", \"given_name\": \"Carolin\", \"identifier\": \"\", \"email\": \"carolin.roesch@env.ethz.ch\", \"affiliation_02\": \"\"}]", "author_email": null, "state": "active", "version": "1.0", "spatial": "{\"type\":\"Point\",\"coordinates\":[9.853594,46.835577]}", "license_id": "odc-odbl", "type": "dataset", "related_publications": "", "num_resources": 2, "title": "Radiosondes", "spatial_info": "Switzerland", "creator_user_id": "b19d31fd-dc57-44f6-8e71-5fb3bd827318", "date": "[{\"date\": \"2019-02-10\", \"date_type\": \"collected\", \"end_date\": \"2019-03-26\"}]", "resource_type_general": "dataset", "relationships_as_subject": [], "name": "radiosondes", "publication_state": "published", "doi": "10.16904/envidat.121", "isopen": true, "language": "en", "url": null, "notes": "Radiosondes (Windsond, Sparv Embedded AB) were started in Davos Wolfgang (LON: 9.853594, LAT: 46.835577) to report height profiles of pressure, relative humidity and temperature at specific days.

These nationally important sites are legally protected and include fens, bogs, dry grasslands, riparian areas, flood plains and amphibian breeding sites. They now are a crucial element of the network of protected sites in Switzerland. In 2011, the WSL Swiss Federal Research Institute and the Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) launched the joint project, \"Monitoring the Effectiveness of Habitat Conservation in Switzerland (WBS)\". Using remote sensing approaches as well as floristic and faunistic field surveys, we monitor whether the sites of national importance are developing along with their conservation targets and whether their area and habitat quality is maintained. \r\nThe remote-sensing module monitors all sites of national importance on a regular basis. Based on these data, an online color-coded warning system has been established to ensure early detection of negative changes and to conduct prompt conservation measures. This tool can be assessed by the responsible federal and cantonal conservation authorities.\r\nThe very laborious field surveys are conducted in a subsample of all sites. Vegetation changes in fens, bogs, dry grasslands, riparian areas and flood plains are interpreted using diversity and compositional measures. The regular sampling of amphibian species and their population-size classes reflect temporal changes in amphibian breeding sites.\r\n\r\nThe project is composed of the following three modules:\r\n\r\n- [_Vegetation module_](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/wbs-vegetation-module)\r\n- [_Amphibian breeding sites module_](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/wbs-amphibian-breeding-sites-module)\r\n- [_Remote-sensing module_](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/wbs-remote-sensing-module) \r\n", "image_display_url": "https://biotopschutz.wsl.ch/fileadmin//user_upload/WSL/Microsite/Wirkungskontrolle-Biotopschutz-Schweiz/HM-Habkern.jpg", "package_count": 0, "created": "2019-08-19T14:23:30.929422", "name": "wbs", "is_organization": false, "state": "active", "extras": [{"value": "Amphibian breeding sites module, Vegetation module, Remote-sensing module", "state": "active", "key": "subprojects", "revision_id": "324cb559-cd60-4839-9219-624c7b0b38c3", "group_id": "895b34a8-add7-4a47-8940-91be28806a5d", "id": "3f783ead-f387-4948-aff0-6389214a9a17"}], "image_url": "https://biotopschutz.wsl.ch/fileadmin//user_upload/WSL/Microsite/Wirkungskontrolle-Biotopschutz-Schweiz/HM-Habkern.jpg", "groups": [], "type": "group", "title": "Monitoring the Effectiveness of Habitat Conservation in Switzerland (WBS)", "revision_id": "9cbbe829-6288-42a6-8b80-08bfe37a2647", "packages": [], "num_followers": 0, "id": "895b34a8-add7-4a47-8940-91be28806a5d", "approval_status": "approved"}, {"display_name": "Precipitation", "description": "Rain or snow reaching the ground as precipitation were measured at a high elevation site and at two locations in the valley over the course of the [RACLETS](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/raclets-field-campaign) campaign: Gotschnagrat (2285 m above sea level - a.s.l.), as well as Laret (1522 m a.s.l.), and Davos Wolfang (1630 m a.s.l.).

In a unique cooperation between cloud and snow research groups, this study aimed to observe the complete life cycle of ice crystals:\r\n\r\n- Cloud droplet formation and ice nucleation on aerosol particles\r\n- Growth of cloud droplets and ice crystals to precipitation\r\n- Ice crystal enhancement by ice multiplication\r\n- Precipitation location and amount on the ground\r\n- Redistribution of snow on the ground\r\n\r\n\r\nThe measurements were contextualized by using regional numerical weather models for the atmosphere and high-resolution models for snow deposition.\r\n\r\nTo explore the campaign sites in a short introduction [video](https://iacweb.ethz.ch/data/holimo/images/Davos_campaign_GE_31_Jan.mp4), just click on the picture below. \r\n<br />\r\n[![IMAGE IS MISSING](https://iacweb.ethz.ch/data/holimo/images/RACLETS-OverviewMap_Scale.png)](https://iacweb.ethz.ch/data/holimo/images/Davos_campaign_GE_31_Jan.mp4)\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nTo cover the spatial differences of the topography, instruments were deployed at five different locations and on a cable car. The main measurement site was located in __Davos Wolfang__, 1630 m above sea level (a.s.l.). Here, [clouds](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/clouds-in-situ-raclets) were probed in-situ by a tethered balloon system (HoloBalloon), [radiosondes](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/meteorology) were launched, [precipitation](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/precipitation) was measured (disdrometer), [remote sensing instruments](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/remote-sensing-raclets) were deployed (OceaNet station, Wind Profiler and Wind LIDAR) and [aerosol and INP measurements](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/aerosols-raclets) were carried out to study the atmosphere. The mountain ridge __Gotschna__ separates Davos Wolfgang in the south from Klosters in the north. In __Klosters__ (1170 m a.s.l.), a [ceilometer](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/remote-sensing-raclets) was applied to measure the cloud base.

In particular, snow cover processes, snow-atmosphere interactions and mountain hydrology are in the focus of current research. This includes a strive for deeper understanding of the complicated mass and energy exchange processes within, above and below a snow cover but also predictions of future snow and ice in mountains and high latitudes. A newer work area is the risk management and optimization in the field of renewable energy production based on our detailed understanding of water, wind and radiation processes in mountains.\r\n\r\nMore information: http://cryos.epfl.ch/", "created": "2016-11-17T12:24:20.447699", "title": "CRYOS", "name": "cryos", "is_organization": true, "state": "active", "image_url": "2019-03-26-151807.125593CRYOSLogoFinal.jpg", "revision_id": "a59a28e8-cb2a-4f3e-bd7d-e742a6efa964", "type": "organization", "id": "b2ef52fe-c56a-4973-8309-24837f3848ed", "approval_status": "approved"}, "revision_id": "78e0a3c5-a07d-4017-9cb6-041d25774a51", "resource_type": "Dataset"}, {"owner_org": "59289253-6fa8-4fe9-a1a2-9d07cc39dcae", "maintainer": "{\"affiliation\": \"Leibnitz Institute for Tropospheric Research (TROPOS)\", \"identifier\": \"\", \"given_name\": \"\", \"name\": \"Patric Seifert\", \"email\": \"seifert@tropos.de\"}", "relationships_as_object": [], "private": false, "maintainer_email": null, "num_tags": 5, "subtitle": "", "id": "9267d575-29d8-4a23-8a24-13df224b5ee5", "metadata_created": "2019-10-09T10:39:41.058361", "funding": "[{\"grant_number\": \"200021_175824\", \"institution\": \"SNF\", \"institution_url\": \"http://p3.snf.ch/project-175824\"}]", "publication": "{\"publisher\": \"EnviDat\", \"publication_year\": \"2019\"}", "metadata_modified": "2020-03-27T07:37:48.292439", "author": "[{\"name\": \"Seifert\", \"data_credit\": [\"collection\", \"validation\", \"curation\"], \"affiliation\": \"Leibnitz Institute for Tropospheric Research (TROPOS)\", \"affiliation_03\": \"\", \"given_name\": \"Patric\", \"identifier\": \"\", \"email\": \"seifert@tropos.de\", \"affiliation_02\": \"\"}, {\"name\": \"Wieder\", \"data_credit\": \"collection\", \"affiliation\": \"IAC\", \"affiliation_03\": \"\", \"given_name\": \"J\u00f6rg\", \"identifier\": \"\", \"email\": \"joerg.wieder@env.ethz.ch\", \"affiliation_02\": \"\"}]", "author_email": null, "state": "active", "version": "1.0", "spatial": "{\"type\":\"Point\",\"coordinates\":[9.853594,46.835577]}", "license_id": "odc-odbl", "type": "dataset", "related_publications": "", "num_resources": 1, "title": "Disdrometer Data Davos Wolfgang", "spatial_info": "Switzerland", "creator_user_id": "b19d31fd-dc57-44f6-8e71-5fb3bd827318", "date": "[{\"date\": \"2019-02-08\", \"date_type\": \"collected\", \"end_date\": \"2019-03-19\"}]", "resource_type_general": "dataset", "relationships_as_subject": [], "name": "disdrometer-data-davos-wolfgang", "publication_state": "published", "doi": "10.16904/envidat.117", "isopen": true, "language": "en", "url": null, "notes": "The dataset contains information on precipitation amount and type for Davos Wolfgang (LON: 9.853594, LAT: 46.835577) from February 8 to March 19 2019.

During RACLETS, the ground-based remote sensing working group participated with observations of the mobile Oceanet platform, which is usually deployed during cruises of the research vessel Polarstern. Oceanet carries a multiwavelength Raman polarization lidar and a microwave radiometer as well as standard meteorological sensors. During RACLETS, a 35-GHz cloud radar and a disdrometer were deployed in addition.

This allows monitoring all sites of national importance on a regular basis. During the first phase of the project (2012 to 2017), the state of the habitats at the times the inventories were compiled (1980s and 1990s) has been compared. The interpretation is done manually on a 3D screen. The images from the 1980s and 1990s are in black and white, whereas the contemporary images are false color infrared stereo images.\r\nTo ensure reproducibility of the interpretation and location of changes within the sites, a grid of 50m x 50 m cells was placed over each site. Within each grid cell, simple indicators such as changes in tree and shrub cover or infrastructures such as roads and buildings are recorded using an ordinal scale with 11 classes (1 \u2259 <0%, 2 \u2259 1\u201310%, 3 \u2259 11\u201320%, 4 \u2259 21\u201330%, 5 \u2259 31\u201340%, 6 \u2259 41\u201350%, 7 \u2259 51\u201360%, 8 \u2259 61\u201370%, 9 \u2259 71\u201380%, 10 \u2259 81\u201390%, 11 \u2259 91\u2013100% cover). This allows a quick interpretation of changes, e.g., abandonment (by shrub encroachment). The centers of the grid cells correspond to the interpreted points of the Swiss Land-Use and Land-Cover Statistics and the Swiss National Forest Inventory (NFI). \r\nBased on these data, an online color-coded warning system has been established to ensure early detection of negative changes and to conduct prompt conservation measures. This tool can be assessed by the responsible federal and cantonal conservation authorities.\r\nThe very laborious field surveys are conducted in a subsample of all sites. Vegetation changes in fens, bogs, dry grasslands, riparian areas and flood plains are interpreted using diversity and compositional measures. The regular sampling of amphibian species and their population-size classes reflect temporal changes in amphibian breeding sites.\r\nIn addition, remote-sensing methods are developed to automatically calculate as many features as possible that are important for the quality of habitats of national importance. One example is shrub encroachment, which is calculated from the canopy height models obtained from the 3D aerial image data.\r\n", "image_display_url": "https://biotopschutz.wsl.ch/fileadmin//user_upload/WSL/Microsite/Wirkungskontrolle-Biotopschutz-Schweiz/stereo.jpg", "package_count": 0, "created": "2019-09-02T15:44:33.164468", "name": "wbs-remote-sensing-module", "is_organization": false, "state": "active", "extras": [{"value": "Monitoring the Effectiveness of Habitat Conservation in Switzerland (WBS)", "state": "active", "key": "parent", "revision_id": "dfaa5dff-7fed-44a6-acc3-31060340d6b0", "group_id": "dcce3fd2-4144-474a-bfd2-e831f6459f4f", "id": "b836bf56-baed-414f-b589-fd3cc254ecf4"}], "image_url": "https://biotopschutz.wsl.ch/fileadmin//user_upload/WSL/Microsite/Wirkungskontrolle-Biotopschutz-Schweiz/stereo.jpg", "groups": [], "type": "group", "title": "Remote-sensing module (WBS)", "revision_id": "d7482ed2-f2e2-47d5-886c-c6848a2dfdde", "packages": [], "num_followers": 0, "id": "dcce3fd2-4144-474a-bfd2-e831f6459f4f", "approval_status": "approved"}, {"display_name": "SCCER BIOSWEET", "description": "The SCCER BIOSWEET aims at providing solutions to problems arising from the energy transition.

Due to phase  out of nuclear energy it is necessary to find new options to maintain this powerful energy system. The Swiss energy strategy 2050 aims to reduce CO2-emissions, increase efficiency and promote renewable energies. The Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL) examined relevant woody and non-woody biomass quantities (cubic meters, fresh-, dry weight) and their energy potentials (in Petajoules: primary energy and biomethane) with a similar methodological approach. The work was done within the frame of the Swiss Competence Centers for Energy Research (SCCER) especially in line with the SCCER Biomass for Swiss energy future (Biosweet). With a uniform and consistent approach for the current potentials ten biomass categories were estimated and aggregated for the whole of Switzerland. In this context solutions for the technical, social and political challenges are promoted. First, considering the different biomass resources characteristics and available data, appropriate methods at the finest scale possible were elaborated to estimate the annual quantities which could theoretically be collected (theoretical potential). Then, explicit and rational restrictions for sustainable bio-energy production were defined according to the current state of the art and subtracted from the theoretical potential to obtain the sustainable potential. The main restrictions are competing material utilizations, environmental factors and supply costs. Finally, the additional sustainable potential was estimated considering the current bioenergy production. Our main purpose was to provide potentials for developing conversion technologies as well as a detailed and comprehensive basis of the Swiss biomass potentials for energy use for economic and political decision makers.

At Laret, ice crystals and snowflakes can be observed which were atmospherically processed while falling. \r\n\r\nIce crystals and water droplets were additionally recorded in-situ with a holographic imager ([HoloGondel](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/clouds-in-situ-raclets), mounted on a cable car, operating between Gotschnaboden (1779 m a.s.l.) and Gotschnagrat (2285 m a.s.l.).\r\nOther parameters measured at Weissfluhjoch included [precipitation](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/precipitation), [aerosol, INP and CCN concentrations](https://www.envidat.ch/group/about/aerosols-raclets).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![image is missing](https://iacweb.ethz.ch/data/holimo/images/notUploaded/Claudia/P2121970_Scale.JPG)\r\n\r\nImage: Claudia Mignani", "image_display_url": "https://www.envidat.ch/uploads/group/2019-08-21-120220.421222RACLETSsnowlogo.png", "package_count": 4, "created": "2019-07-11T14:06:09.290756", "name": "snow", "is_organization": false, "state": "active", "extras": [{"value": "RACLETS Field Campaign", "state": "active", "key": "parent", "revision_id": "a87610d8-0aa4-488a-83bc-c3707e350ce3", "group_id": "323fdb70-959b-4bfc-bff4-e16b6907161e", "id": "6e537540-5d9e-4ddc-93a2-ee1e47aee6f1"}], "image_url": "2019-08-21-120220.421222RACLETSsnowlogo.png", "groups": [], "type": "group", "title": "Snow", "revision_id": "21320731-a037-4678-bca7-407dece1f371", "packages": [{"owner_org": "f2a8afe5-e84e-454b-b5d9-6c1bf682eabd", "maintainer": "{\"affiliation\": \"WSL\", \"identifier\": \"\", \"given_name\": \"Benjamin\", \"name\": \"Walter\", \"email\": \"walter@slf.ch\"}", "relationships_as_object": [], "private": false, "maintainer_email": null, "num_tags": 6, "subtitle": "", "id": "898d94a9-7a48-4fdc-9eda-43f536e39285", "metadata_created": "2019-11-06T12:22:23.566981", "funding": "[{\"grant_number\": \"\", \"institution\": \"WSL\", \"institution_url\": \"\"}]", "publication": "{\"publisher\": \"EnviDat\", \"publication_year\": \"2019\"}", "metadata_modified": "2020-10-29T15:47:42.337415", "author": "[{\"name\": \"Walter\", \"data_credit\": [\"collection\", \"software\", \"publication\"], \"affiliation\": \"WSL\", \"affiliation_03\": \"\", \"given_name\": \"Benjamin\", \"identifier\": \"\", \"email\": \"walter@slf.ch\", \"affiliation_02\": \"\"}, {\"name\": \"Huwald\", \"data_credit\": \"software\", \"email\": \"hendrik.huwald@epfl.ch\", \"affiliation\": \"WSL\", \"affiliation_03\": \"\", \"given_name\": \"Hendrik\", \"identifier\": \"\", \"affiliation_02\": \"School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering, EPFL\"}, {\"name\": \"Gehring\", \"data_credit\": \"collection\", \"email\": \"josue.gehring@epfl.ch\", \"affiliation\": \"School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering, EPFL\", \"affiliation_03\": \"\", \"given_name\": \"Josu\\u00e8\", \"identifier\": \"\", \"affiliation_02\": \"\"}]", "author_email": null, "state": "active", "version": "1.0", "spatial": "{\"type\": \"Point\", \"coordinates\": [9.849, 46.859]}", "license_id": "odc-odbl", "type": "dataset", "related_publications": "Walter B., H.

Carbon contained in the decaying biomass is released to the atmosphere as respired CO2, and may contribute to global warming. Litterbag studies have been used to improve our knowledge of the drivers of litter decomposition, but they lack comparability because litter quality is plant species-specific. The use of commercial tea bags as a standard substrate was suggested in order to harmonize studies, where green tea and rooibos represent more labile and more recalcitrant C compounds as surrogates of local litter.\r\nThe tea bag approach was implemented on eight sites of the Swiss long-term Forest Ecosystem Research (LWF) network (https://www.wsl.ch/LWF). This allowed us to take advantage from the existing infrastructure and data from a previous litterbag study with local litter. In Beatenberg and Schaenis, additional elevation transects were established (1200-1800 m and 540-1150 m, respectively) to examine particularly the effect of temperature on decomposition. In Pfynwald (https://www.wsl.ch/de/ueber-die-wsl/versuchsanlagen-und-labors/flaechen-im-wald/pfynwald.html) and Salgesch, infrastructure of running projects was used to examine the effect of drought and understory removal, respectively. In Novaggio, tea bags were incubated in summer and winter to study the effect of seasonality particularly precipitation. Tea bags are collected after 3, 12, 24, and 36 months; for the two time-shifted experiments additionally after 6 and 9 months.\r\nThe study has two primary objectives. Firstly, it contributes to TeaComposition initiative (http://teacomposition.org/) which aims at investigating long-term litter decomposition and its key drivers at present as well as under different future climate scenarios using a common protocol and standard litter (tea) across nine terrestrial biomes. Secondly, the data are used to further develop decomposition models such as Yasso (http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/yasso) which is used by several countries, including Switzerland to estimate the annual carbon fluxes in dead wood, litter, and soil for reporting in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol.\r\n", "license_title": "ODbL with Database Contents License (DbCL)", "license_url": "https://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl", "organization": {"description": "__Air pollution and climate change have an effect on the forest.

The sample includes approximately 400 dry grassland sites, 260 bogs and fens, and 125 riparian areas and flood plains of national importance. In total, more than 7000 permanently marked circular 10 m2 plots were established in the first sampling period from (2011 to 2017). In all these plots all vascular plants are sampled every six years. In addition, in riparian areas and flood plains, shrubs and trees are sampled in a second 200 m2 plot (concentric with the 10 m2 plot). In fens and bogs, beside vascular plants soil-dwelling bryophytes (i.e. mosses, liverworts, hornworts) are recorded. \r\nThe floristic data is also transferred to the national data centers, i.e. Info Flora (National data center of the Swiss flora) and Swiss Bryophytes (National data center of Swiss bryophytes) and used for other national projects, such as the national Red List of Endangered species programs. In addition, data are available for specific research projects on request. \r\nUsing the same sampling methods in all habitat types allows the comparison among vegetation types. Moreover, these methods correspond to the ones of other national monitoring programs, i.e., the Swiss Biodiversity Monitoring (BDM) and the agro-environmental monitoring (ALL-EMA). The three monitoring projects complement each other perfectly. While BDM reflects a random picture of the \u2018normal landscape\u2019 of Switzerland (including settlements) and ALL-EMA covers a wide range of (mesic) agriculturally used grasslands with different land-use intensities, WBS mirrors rare vegetation types with diverse ecological conditions, i.e. protected areas from dry steppe habitat types in the inner-alpine dry valleys over dry to mesic agriculturally used grasslands to wetlands, fens and bogs. Thus, the whole ecological and land-use intensity gradient of various habitat types in Switzerland is covered, allowing synthesis analyses to answer more general questions.\r\n", "image_display_url": "https://www.envidat.ch/uploads/group/2019-09-04-114151.02183520190710w1977.jpg", "package_count": 0, "created": "2019-09-02T15:42:02.975326", "name": "wbs-vegetation-module", "is_organization": false, "state": "active", "extras": [{"value": "Monitoring the Effectiveness of Habitat Conservation in Switzerland (WBS)", "state": "active", "key": "parent", "revision_id": "744ca754-aec9-4e3c-ad51-f83f2a8bb5c1", "group_id": "3508550d-58a6-4d2f-b2fc-e5d15685e5ae", "id": "f96274ce-b3b0-4cc2-b404-a40e6b9175cc"}], "image_url": "2019-09-04-114151.02183520190710w1977.jpg", "groups": [], "type": "group", "title": "Vegetation module (WBS)", "revision_id": "d4b6a4fd-1aa6-4f4e-a714-23a6e25606db", "packages": [], "num_followers": 0, "id": "3508550d-58a6-4d2f-b2fc-e5d15685e5ae", "approval_status": "approved"}, {"display_name": "Weissfluhjoch Research Site", "description": "The institute's former main building on the Weissfluhjoch remains at its disposal for research purposes.
